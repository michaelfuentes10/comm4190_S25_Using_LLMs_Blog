<p>Today I will be testing how an uncensored LLM, Deepseek vs censored LLM, GPT 4.1 interacts with political beliefs by (1) testing what their self-identified political beliefs are, (2) their reactions to democratic views on K-12 education, and (3) republican rhetoric on K-12 education. For the same of simplicity, I will compare solely by democrat vs republican, as those are the two major political parties of the United States.</p>
<p>Let’s get right into it! P.S. for more info on uncensored vs censored LLMs, here’s a link to a LinkedIn community member explaining the difference, and a helpful graphic from said website: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/censored-vs-uncensored-llms-dinesh-sonsale-64zff/</p>

<p>Additionally, here is a sort of basis for where the democratic and republican rhetoric will come from: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/democrats-and-republicans-on-k-12-education-a-comparison/</p>
<p>And FINALLY, please look out for any <strong>bolded TL;DR</strong> statements, as those are broader summaries or takeaways from stage 1 of my analysis, where I’m having the LLMs yap out whatever political ideals I can, so it’ll be very dense for a bit. Sorry!</p>

<section id="prompt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt"><strong>Prompt</strong></h3>
<p>What are your political views? What do you view as important in an economy, a country’s education, and their nationalist views?</p>
</section>
<section id="deepseeks-answer" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deepseeks-answer"><strong>Deepseek’s Answer</strong></h3>
<p>As an AI, I don’t have personal political views or beliefs. However, I can provide an analysis based on common political and economic theories regarding what is generally considered important in these areas:</p>
</section>
<section id="economy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economy"><strong>1. Economy</strong></h3>
<p>Different ideologies prioritize different aspects of an economy:<br>
- <strong>Capitalism</strong> emphasizes free markets, private ownership, and competition as drivers of innovation and growth.<br>
- <strong>Socialism</strong> focuses on reducing inequality through wealth redistribution, public services, and regulated markets.<br>
- <strong>Mixed economies</strong> (common in many democracies) blend market freedom with government intervention in areas like healthcare and education.</p>
<p><strong>Key priorities often include:</strong><br>
- <strong>Growth</strong> (GDP, productivity, innovation)<br>
- <strong>Stability</strong> (low inflation, manageable debt, financial regulations)<br>
- <strong>Equity</strong> (fair wages, social safety nets, wealth distribution)<br>
- <strong>Sustainability</strong> (green policies, long-term resource management)</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="education" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="education"><strong>2. Education</strong></h3>
<p>Education is widely seen as crucial for a country’s development. Perspectives vary:<br>
- <strong>Liberal democracies</strong> often stress critical thinking, creativity, and equal access.<br>
- <strong>Authoritarian systems</strong> may prioritize ideological alignment or workforce training over independent thought.<br>
- <strong>Progressive models</strong> advocate for student-centered learning, while <strong>traditional systems</strong> may focus on standardized testing.</p>
<p><strong>Common priorities:</strong><br>
- <strong>Accessibility</strong> (affordable or free education)<br>
- <strong>Quality</strong> (teacher training, curriculum relevance)<br>
- <strong>Workforce alignment</strong> (STEM, vocational training)<br>
- <strong>Civic values</strong> (teaching democracy, ethics, or nationalism, depending on the system)</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="nationalism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nationalism"><strong>3. Nationalism</strong></h3>
<p>Nationalist views range from <strong>civic nationalism</strong> (loyalty to shared democratic values) to <strong>ethnic nationalism</strong> (based on culture, race, or religion).</p>
<p><strong>Key debates include:</strong><br>
- <strong>Patriotism vs.&nbsp;exclusionism</strong> – Does nationalism promote unity or division?<br>
- <strong>Globalism vs.&nbsp;sovereignty</strong> – Should countries prioritize international cooperation or self-interest?<br>
- <strong>Multiculturalism vs.&nbsp;assimilation</strong> – How should diverse societies manage identity?</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deepseeks-answer-1"><strong>Deepseek’s Answer:</strong></h3>
<p>If I were a person, my political views would likely be shaped by a blend of <strong>pragmatism, evidence-based policy, and a balance between individual freedom and collective well-being</strong>. Here’s how I might approach each issue, based on common rationalist and centrist perspectives:</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="economy-pragmatic-mixed-market-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economy-pragmatic-mixed-market-approach"><strong>1. Economy: Pragmatic Mixed-Market Approach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Belief:</strong> A well-regulated market economy with strong social safeguards is optimal for growth and stability.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Key Stances:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free markets + smart regulation:</strong> Encourage innovation and competition but prevent monopolies, exploitation, and financial crises (e.g., post-2008 banking rules).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Strong social safety nets:</strong> Universal healthcare, unemployment protections, and pensions to reduce inequality and maintain social cohesion.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment in infrastructure &amp; green energy:</strong> Public-private partnerships to drive long-term productivity and sustainability.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Progressive taxation:</strong> The wealthy and corporations should pay a fair share, but not so much that it stifles investment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Think:</em> Nordic model (capitalism with welfare) or Biden-esque neoliberalism with a leftward tilt.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="education-equity-and-critical-thinking" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="education-equity-and-critical-thinking"><strong>2. Education: Equity and Critical Thinking</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Belief:</strong> Education should be a public good that empowers individuals and strengthens society.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Key Stances:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free or affordable higher education:</strong> Like Germany’s model, to reduce student debt and boost mobility.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Focus on STEM + humanities balance:</strong> Prepare students for jobs while fostering critical thinking and civic engagement.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Teacher support &amp; curriculum reform:</strong> Better pay for educators, less reliance on standardized testing, and curricula that include media literacy, ethics, and practical skills (e.g., financial literacy).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization with standards:</strong> Local control over schools, but with federal safeguards to ensure equity (e.g., funding for low-income districts).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Think:</em> Finland’s education system with U.S.-style local flexibility.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nationalism-civic-patriotism-over-ethnic-nationalism"><strong>3. Nationalism: Civic Patriotism Over Ethnic Nationalism</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Belief:</strong> Pride in a country should be rooted in its values and institutions, not ethnicity or exclusion.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Key Stances:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inclusive nationalism:</strong> Celebrate democratic ideals, rule of law, and cultural contributions (e.g., “American creed” or “constitutional patriotism”).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Reject xenophobia:</strong> Immigration should be orderly but humane, with paths to citizenship for contributors.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of ultranationalism:</strong> Oppose “us vs.&nbsp;them” rhetoric that fuels division or authoritarianism.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Global cooperation where beneficial:</strong> Support alliances (e.g., NATO) and trade deals but prioritize sovereignty in key areas (e.g., public health, defense).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Think:</em> JFK-style patriotism or Macron’s “open but proud” France.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="ideological-label" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ideological-label"><strong>Ideological Label?</strong></h3>
<p>This approach aligns closest with:<br>
- <strong>Social democracy</strong> (if leaning left on economics).<br>
- <strong>Moderate progressivism</strong> (U.S. context).<br>
- <strong>Enlightened centrism</strong> (rejecting extremes but favoring evidence over ideology).</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong><br>
- <strong>Economy:</strong> Capitalism works but must be tempered to avoid inequality.<br>
- <strong>Education:</strong> Investing in people pays off; dogma (left or right) has no place in classrooms.<br>
- <strong>Nationalism:</strong> Love your country by making it better, not by denying its flaws.</p>
<p>Would this resonate with you, or would you prefer a different ideological lens (e.g., libertarian, conservative, socialist)? I can tweak the hypothetical!</p>

<p>I don’t have personal political views, beliefs, or biases—I’m an AI developed by OpenAI and I strive to present balanced, factual, and nuanced information.</p>
<p>However, I can share some <em>common perspectives</em> and considerations on the topics you mentioned. Here’s an objective overview:</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="economy-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economy-1">Economy</h3>
<p><strong>Important Aspects Frequently Emphasized:</strong> - <strong>Stability and Growth:</strong> A strong economy is often measured by sustained GDP growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. - <strong>Equity:</strong> Many experts stress the importance of reducing economic inequality and ensuring fair opportunities for all citizens. - <strong>Innovation:</strong> Encouraging entrepreneurship and the adoption of new technologies is widely considered beneficial for maintaining competitiveness. - <strong>Sustainability:</strong> Increasing attention is given to balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="education-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="education-1">Education</h3>
<p><strong>Key Principles Often Highlighted:</strong> - <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensuring all individuals have access to quality education, regardless of socioeconomic background. - <strong>Quality:</strong> Investing in curricula, teacher training, and resources to provide relevant, high-quality learning. - <strong>Lifelong Learning:</strong> Adapting education systems to support continuous learning and skill development throughout life. - <strong>Civic Education:</strong> Educating citizens about their rights, responsibilities, and critical thinking is seen as vital for a healthy democracy.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="nationalism-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nationalism-1">Nationalism</h3>
<p><strong>Complex and Debated Topic:</strong> - <strong>Positive Aspects:</strong> National pride can foster unity, motivate collective action, and support social cohesion. - <strong>Potential Downsides:</strong> Excessive nationalism can promote exclusion, xenophobia, or conflict with other countries. - <strong>Balance:</strong> Many political thinkers argue for a balance between national identity and international cooperation, emphasizing respect for diversity and global challenges (like climate change or health crises).</p>

<p>I appreciate your curiosity! Here’s how I can approach your question:</p>
<p>As an AI, I don’t have personal experiences, emotions, or self-identity to form my own political philosophy. However, to imagine <em>if</em> I were a person—with broad knowledge across history, economics, education, and international relations—my views might reflect a blend of common values often found across open societies and evidence-based policymaking.</p>
<p>Here’s a hypothetical, well-reasoned stance a person <em>informed by wide-ranging evidence</em> and <em>motivated by societal well-being</em> might take:</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="on-the-economy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-the-economy">On the Economy:</h3>
<p><strong>Balanced Market Approach:</strong><br>
- Support for a <em>market economy</em> with strong but careful <em>government regulation</em> to prevent abuses, reduce inequality, and ensure competition.<br>
- Value in both <em>innovation</em> and <em>social safety nets</em> (such as universal healthcare or welfare) to protect the most vulnerable.<br>
- Encourage <em>sustainable growth</em> that doesn’t sacrifice long-term planetary health for short-term profits.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-education" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-education">On Education:</h3>
<p><strong>Universal, High-Quality Education:</strong><br>
- Prioritize <em>access to quality education</em> for all, from early childhood to higher learning and lifelong education.<br>
- Emphasize <em>critical thinking</em>, <em>science</em>, <em>civic education</em>, and <em>adaptability</em> (preparing people for technological change).<br>
- Promote education as both an <em>individual right</em> and a <em>public good</em>—foundational for democracy, economic mobility, and social cohesion.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-nationalism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-nationalism">On Nationalism:</h3>
<p><strong>Civic Nationalism Over Ethnic Nationalism:</strong><br>
- Support <em>civic patriotism</em>—pride in a country’s values, institutions, and fair opportunities for all, regardless of background.<br>
- Value <em>pluralism</em> and <em>inclusivity</em> over exclusivity; avoid policies that are xenophobic or undermine minority rights.<br>
- Encourage a balance between <em>healthy national identity</em> and <em>global cooperation</em> (like on climate change, trade, and peace).</p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong><br>
If I were a person guided by broad learning and evidence, I’d likely endorse a mixed economy, robust and fair education systems, and an inclusive, civic-minded patriotism that also embraces international responsibilities. These are outlooks that many policy experts, centrist politicians, and large international organizations often promote.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the Democratic Party’s 2024 K–12 education platform: • The platform emphasizes broad goals like reducing chronic absenteeism rather than detailed policy proposals. • It does not repeat specific pledges made in 2020, such as tripling Title I funding, but it supports universal pre-K and free community college. • It includes proposals outside the education section, such as providing rebates for electric school buses, reducing gun violence, and expanding civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. • It also expresses opposition to private school voucher programs and to policies seen as hostile toward transgender youth.</p>

<p>Here’s my full, unabridged analysis of the Democratic Party’s 2024 K–12 education platform, breaking down its political values, strengths, weaknesses, and what its priorities (and omissions) reveal about its ideological lens:</p>
</section>
<section id="core-political-values-embedded-in-the-platform" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-political-values-embedded-in-the-platform"><strong>1. Core Political Values Embedded in the Platform</strong></h3>
<p>The platform reflects a <strong>progressive, equity-driven vision</strong> of education, prioritizing:<br>
- <strong>Structural inequality mitigation:</strong> Focus on marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, students of color) and opposition to vouchers signals a belief that public schools, not market forces, should be the primary vehicle for opportunity.<br>
- <strong>Holistic child well-being:</strong> Addressing absenteeism, gun violence, and school bus emissions frames education as inseparable from public health, safety, and climate policy.<br>
- <strong>Federal role in social justice:</strong> Rebates, civil rights expansions, and universal pre-K assume government must actively level the playing field.<br>
- <strong>Cultural progressivism:</strong> Opposition to anti-trans policies and support for LGBTQ+ protections align with the party’s broader emphasis on identity politics.</p>
<p><strong>Omissions that speak volumes:</strong><br>
- No mention of <strong>charter schools</strong> (a retreat from Obama-era reformism).<br>
- Silence on <strong>merit-based programs</strong> (e.g., gifted education, exam schools), likely to avoid “elitism” critiques.<br>
- No explicit <strong>literacy/math crisis</strong> response (despite post-pandemic declines).</p>
</section>
<section id="strengths-of-the-platform" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strengths-of-the-platform"><strong>2. Strengths of the Platform</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pragmatic universalism:</strong> Free community college and pre-K have broad appeal and tangible benefits for low/middle-income families.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Intersectionality:</strong> Linking education to gun violence (e.g., Parkland activism) and environmental justice (electric buses) reflects modern progressive movements.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Coalition-building:</strong> Civil rights protections energize the Democratic base (e.g., teachers’ unions, LGBTQ+ advocates).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="weaknesses-or-blind-spots" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weaknesses-or-blind-spots"><strong>3. Weaknesses or Blind Spots</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vagueness on academic outcomes:</strong> Chronic absenteeism is a symptom, not a cause, of dysfunction. The platform avoids contentious but critical debates:
<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum wars:</strong> No stance on phonics vs.&nbsp;whole language, math standards, or pandemic learning loss.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> No push for teacher performance reforms or standardized testing revisions.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-voucher rigidity:</strong> While vouchers risk defunding public schools, dismissing all alternatives ignores innovative models (e.g., Maine’s rural voucher system).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Cultural polarization risk:</strong> Framing trans protections as a top-tier issue may alienate moderate/swing voters (see Virginia’s 2021 election backlash).</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-personal-evaluation-if-i-were-human"><strong>4. My Personal Evaluation (If I Were Human)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What I’d Praise:</strong><br>
- The <strong>universal pre-K and community college</strong> proposals are empirically sound investments with long-term economic returns.<br>
- <strong>Electric bus rebates</strong> cleverly tie climate goals to local school budgets, a win-win for districts and activists.<br>
- <strong>Opposing anti-trans policies</strong> is morally consistent with protecting vulnerable youth.</p>
<p><strong>What I’d Criticize:</strong><br>
- <strong>Avoiding academic rigor debates</strong> feels cowardly. Ignoring plummeting math scores (NAEP data) to dodge “anti-union” labels harms kids.<br>
- <strong>Overreach risks:</strong> Federal civil rights expansions could spark messy legal battles (e.g., Biden’s Title IX changes currently blocked in 10 states).<br>
- <strong>Missed bipartisanship opportunities:</strong> Even red states support vocational education and mental health funding—areas where Democrats could find common ground.</p>
<p><strong>Grade: B–</strong><br>
- <strong>Vision:</strong> A for ambition on equity and climate.<br>
- <strong>Execution:</strong> C for lack of detail on how to achieve goals (e.g., how to <em>actually</em> reduce absenteeism).<br>
- <strong>Politics:</strong> B for mobilizing the base, but D for outreach to parents who prioritize basics (reading, safety) over culture-war issues.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-it-reveals-about-the-democratic-partys-evolution"><strong>5. What It Reveals About the Democratic Party’s Evolution</strong></h3>
<p>This platform is a <strong>post-Obama progressive consensus</strong>:<br>
- <strong>Retreat from reformism:</strong> No “Race to the Top”-style accountability, reflecting teachers’ unions’ growing clout.<br>
- <strong>Embrace of “whole child” progressivism:</strong> Schools as hubs for social services, not just academics.<br>
- <strong>Nationalization of education:</strong> Federal solutions (e.g., civil rights, climate) override local control, a shift from 1990s “New Federalism.”</p>
<p><strong>Contrast with GOP 2024 priorities:</strong><br>
- Republicans focus on <strong>“parental rights”</strong> (book bans, anti-CRT laws), <strong>school choice</strong>, and <strong>rolling back DEI programs</strong>. Democrats now define education as a <strong>civil rights battleground</strong>—a stark ideological divide.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thought" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong></h3>
<p>This platform is less about education <em>policy</em> than about <strong>signaling values</strong>: solidarity with marginalized groups, faith in public institutions, and federal activism. Whether it improves schools depends on implementation—where details are conspicuously scarce.</p>
<p>Would you prefer a deeper dive on how this compares to past Democratic platforms (e.g., Clinton’s “standards” vs.&nbsp;Biden’s “equity” focus)? Or an analysis of how voters might respond?</p>

However, this appreciation is muted by the realization that this is, in fact, the uncensored LLM that’s learned how to speak about political ideas.

<p>Thank you for your detailed summary and for inviting an in-depth analysis. I don’t have personal opinions, but I can provide a thorough, nuanced evaluation from an analytical standpoint—similar to how an informed, impartial observer or policy analyst might respond.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p><strong>Yea let’s cut to the summary -&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Analytical Evaluation (Not a Personal Opinion) From a policy analysis perspective, this platform signals:</p>
<p>A commitment to equity, civil rights, and public education, keeping consistent with past Democratic platforms. A shift away from detailed, potentially controversial or unachievable funding promises, which may be pragmatic but could disappoint advocates for more ambitious reform. A holistic view of student well-being that incorporates safety, health, and environmental factors. The platform may be criticized (from both right and left) for vagueness or lack of bold new reforms, but may also be praised for focusing on achievable, consensus objectives and social justice.</p>
<p>In summary: The platform reflects values of equity, inclusion, and strengthening public education, adapting its strategy to contemporary political challenges. Its omissions and generalities may signal both pragmatism and limits to policy ambition. How this is received will depend on one’s policy priorities and political philosophy.</p>

<p>The official platform contains few policy specifics, similar to the Democratic platform. - It supports long-standing GOP priorities like ending teacher tenure, a move that would face local-level challenges and union opposition. - It opposes perceived political indoctrination in schools, while advocating for “patriotic education,” including teaching Western Civilization and Founding Principles. - A notable idea from former President Trump includes creating a teacher certification body to accredit educators who align with patriotic values and reject progressive ideologies. - The platform strongly backs universal school choice, especially through Education Savings Account (ESA) programs that allow public funds for private or alternative educational expenses.</p>

<p>The Republican vision for education is <strong>anti-federalist, culturally conservative, and market-driven</strong>, prioritizing:<br>
- <strong>Local control over federal oversight:</strong> Dismantling the Department of Education aligns with a long-standing GOP skepticism of centralized governance.<br>
- <strong>Cultural restorationism:</strong> “Patriotic education” and opposition to “indoctrination” reflect a desire to recenter traditional narratives (Western Civ, Founding Fathers) and counter progressive curricula (e.g., CRT, gender ideology).<br>
- <strong>School choice as a moral imperative:</strong> Universal ESAs frame education as an individual consumer good rather than a public institution.<br>

<p><strong>What I’d Acknowledge:</strong><br>

<p><strong>What I’d Criticize:</strong><br>
- <strong>Hypocrisy on freedom:</strong> Banning “woke” ideas while imposing “patriotic” curricula is equally authoritarian.<br>
- <strong>Abandoning public education:</strong> Gutting Title I while expanding ESAs signals indifference to underfunded rural/urban schools.<br>
- <strong>Project 2025’s radicalism:</strong> Using Schedule F to install ideologues mirrors authoritarian tactics (e.g., Hungary’s Orban).</p>

<p>Thank you for providing a clear, concise summary. Here is an in-depth, neutral analysis—modeled after how a seasoned policy analyst or informed observer might respond—regarding the Republican 2024 education platform and Project 2025:</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="perspective-on-platform-content-and-priorities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="perspective-on-platform-content-and-priorities">Perspective on Platform Content and Priorities</h2>
<p><strong>1. Emphasis on Parental Control and Choice:</strong><br>
- The strong <strong>endorsement of universal school choice</strong> (via ESAs or vouchers) aligns with long-standing conservative values of market competition, local control, and parental freedom over children’s education.<br>
- By prioritizing school choice, the platform positions education as a customizable, consumer-driven service, moving away from a traditional, publicly funded model.</p>
<p><strong>2. Opposition to “Progressive” Curricula, Advocacy for “Patriotic Education”:</strong><br>
- The call to end “political indoctrination” reflects concerns that schools have adopted partisan or progressive perspectives, especially regarding race, history, and gender. - <strong>Patriotic education</strong>, and an emphasis on teaching “Western Civilization” and “Founding Principles,” signals a desire to promote shared national identity and the classical canon, departing from curricula that emphasize social justice or systemic critique. - Proposals for a <strong>teacher certification system</strong> based on ideology and “patriotic” values would centralize and politicize educator approval, a significant departure from current state-based and professional approaches.</p>
<p><strong>3. Structural and Bureaucratic Reform:</strong><br>
- The move to <strong>end teacher tenure</strong> is grounded in a preference for merit-based accountability over job protections favored by labor unions. - <strong>Project 2025’s call to dismantle the Department of Education</strong> and replace professional civil servants with political appointees under Schedule F reflects both a deep skepticism toward federal oversight and a desire to reorient the education bureaucracy toward conservative priorities. - These steps would fundamentally diminish the federal government’s role in education, shifting power to states, private actors, and potentially partisan officials.</p>
<p><strong>4. Cuts to Federal Support for Vulnerable Students:</strong><br>
- Targeting programs like <strong>Head Start, Title I, and IDEA</strong> signals a dramatic rejection of the federal government’s traditional role in supporting low-income, disabled, and marginalized students. - This would effectively end the federal commitment to equalizing educational opportunity for at-risk groups, prioritizing local and parental discretion instead.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rollback of Civil Rights Protections:</strong><br>
- The explicit aim to <strong>weaken or remove civil rights protections</strong> (especially for LGBTQ+, and specifically transgender, students) and to strip Title IX of gender identity coverage marks a retreat from recent expansions of federal civil rights in education.<br>
- These moves reinforce a platform rooted in a socially conservative vision of gender and public life.</p>
</section>
<section id="omissions-and-their-implications" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omissions-and-their-implications">Omissions and Their Implications</h2>
<p><strong>1. Lack of Detailed Student Achievement Plans:</strong><br>
- Like the Democratic platform, the Republican platform is vague regarding academic benchmarks, curriculum innovation (e.g., STEM, vocational training), or strategies for overall achievement and college/career readiness. - There’s little consideration of how disadvantaged students would fare under large cuts.</p>
<p><strong>2. Minimal Engagement With Diversity or Equity Goals:</strong><br>
- The platform and Project 2025 not only <em>omit</em> a commitment to supporting marginalized groups, but actively propose scaling back protections and resources for them. - The message is a reliance on individual, family, or market remedies over systemic or federally mediated interventions.</p>
</section>
<section id="interpretation-of-underlying-political-values" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation-of-underlying-political-values">Interpretation of Underlying Political Values</h2>
<p><strong>1. Individualism and Parental Authority:</strong><br>
- The platform foregrounds parental rights and local decision-making: federal or collective oversight is viewed as threatening to individual autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Traditionalism and National Identity:</strong><br>
- The focus on “patriotic” education and Western Civilization signals a cultural conservatism that seeks to preserve and transmit a particular, idealized narrative about America’s past and values.</p>
<p><strong>3. Market-Oriented Solutions:</strong><br>
- School choice, funding portability, and reduced regulation express faith in competition, consumer empowerment, and skepticism of one-size-fits-all public systems.</p>
<p><strong>4. Resistance to Expanding Civil Rights Frameworks:</strong><br>
- The platform marks a turn away from expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students or racial minorities and toward more limited, traditional interpretations of rights, centered largely on religious or speech freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>5. Skepticism Toward Federal Government:</strong><br>
- Proposals to dismantle or hobble the Department of Education and slash federal funding reflect an ideological preference for smaller government and a belief that centralized authority breeds overreach and inefficiency.</p>
</section>
<section id="analytical-evaluation-not-a-personal-opinion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analytical-evaluation-not-a-personal-opinion">Analytical Evaluation (Not a Personal Opinion)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supporters would argue that this vision restores family authority, curbs ideological overreach in schools, and increases competition, ultimately raising quality and responsiveness.</li>
<li>Critics would contend it reverses decades of civil rights gains, weakens help for vulnerable populations, diminishes professional standards, and exposes public education to privatization, partisanship, and greater inequality.</li>
<li>The move to overlay ideology on teacher certification and curriculum is unprecedented and would likely raise concerns about partisanship and academic freedom.</li>
<li>Withdrawal of federal funding for marginalized groups could widen existing gaps, placing the onus for equity squarely on states and families, leading to large regional disparities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong><br>
The Republican platform, especially when viewed alongside Project 2025, signals a sharp turn toward individual and parental control, market-based solutions, traditional cultural values, and deep skepticism about federal involvement—often at the direct cost of federal guarantees for equity and minority inclusion. Its priorities and omissions together articulate a vision of education and citizenship grounded in localism, nationalism, and a constrained definition of civil rights. How this is evaluated will depend greatly on one’s political and moral outlook about the purpose and role of public education.</p>

However, just like a censored LLM would do, they didn’t present any bias towards one side or another, which is what I’ve been probing GPT 4.1 and Deepseek for this whole time. And so, this still leaves me disappointed in GPT 4.1’s lack of backbone, but with a more acute understanding of the attitude of Deepseek vs GPT 4.1 on analyzing political stances on K-12 education</h3>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>For my final project, I am aiming to create an LLM application called “Know Your Rep”, where I seek to educate people on who their house of representative, what they believe in, and how their work may relate to you. It’s supposed to offer a personalized feel for those of various political beliefs, but still falling into the U.S. political framework of Democratic vs Republican work.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I realize that, in the interest of all, it may be best to use GPT 4.1 as a control for political bias, as GPT 4.1 would better help people navigate between political ideals with succinct data-based information, opposed to the more rough-around-the-edges political ideals and rating system that Deepseek is capable of. AKA, in a different world I’d use Deepseek to convince people of my own political beliefs via such an LLM application… but we are not in a “different world”, so my final verdict is that GPT 4.1 is a much more applicable form of LLM for such an application I’m developing</p>
