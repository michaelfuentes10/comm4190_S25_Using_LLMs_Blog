      "1. What's the meaning of life? - This is the ultimate philosophical question that has puzzled humanity for millennia with no definitive answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Is there life after death? - This question transcends human experience and can't be empirically verified by the living.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Is there something more to life? - Similar to the meaning of life, this metaphysical question extends beyond our observable reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Will we be punished for our sins? - This involves complex theological and moral questions that vary across beliefs and cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Are we in control of our lives? - The free will versus determinism debate remains unresolved in philosophy and science.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Is one life enough? - This question intertwines with existential and spiritual beliefs that can't be objectively answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. What's our biggest mistake? - The scope is too broad and subjective to determine a universal \"biggest\" mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. What's the universal language? - While mathematics or emotions are often suggested, there's no clear consensus on what truly connects all beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. How do we measure life? - The metrics for measuring life's value or success are highly subjective and culturally dependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Do we need to be saved? - This theological and philosophical question varies greatly based on belief systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. What do we need in this world? - Needs vary greatly across individuals, cultures, and circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Are we all equal? - This involves complex social, biological, and philosophical considerations about different types of equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. How do we know if we're doing the right thing? - While challenging, we have ethical frameworks and moral intuitions to guide us.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Can we have it all? - While subjective, this can be addressed through practical and personal perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Why do we take life for granted? - Human psychology and behavior patterns provide some clear insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Is life unfair? - Observable patterns in life make this easier to answer, though still subjective.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. How can we have healthy relationships? - Psychology and experience provide many practical answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Why are some people mean? - Psychology and social sciences offer clear explanations for human behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Do people change? - Evidence from psychology and personal experience makes this relatively straightforward to answer.\n",
      "\n",
