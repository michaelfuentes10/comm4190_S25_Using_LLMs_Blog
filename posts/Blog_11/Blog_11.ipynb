Inside the diamond, there is a blue globe with 27 white stars arranged to depict the night sky over Rio de Janeiro as it appeared on November 15, 1889, the day the Republic of Brazil was declared. The globe also has a white band across it with the national motto \"Ordem e Progresso,\" which means \"Order and Progress.\" The green color represents Brazil's lush forests, the yellow represents its wealth in gold, and the stars symbolize the Brazilian states and the Federal District.\n",
