    "1. **Alignment with Mission** – Passion for improving housing/healthcare through AI.  \n",
    "2. **Attention to Detail** – Ability to evaluate AI outputs rigorously (fact-checking, bias detection, etc.).  \n",
    "3. **Collaboration & Feedback** – Comfort giving/receiving constructive criticism in a fast-paced startup.  \n",
    "4. **Execution Under Pressure** – Hitting daily targets without sacrificing accuracy.  \n",
    "5. **Communication Skills** – Fluent, precise English (written/spoken) for bug reports and cross-team work.  \n",

    " \n",
    "**Applicant Assessment** *(Assuming hypothetical candidate responses)*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**If the applicant demonstrates:**  \n",
    "✅ **Mission-Driven Mindset** – Mentions interest in housing/healthcare tech impact.  \n",
    "✅ **Analytical Rigor** – Examples of meticulous review (e.g., academic research, QA testing).  \n",
    "✅ **Startup Fit** – Shows hunger for unstructured growth (\"writing the playbook\").  \n",

    "Well well, it looks like GPT 4.1 got hired! They seemed to buidl off the role play pretty well, understanding that they are an AI LLM directed to help people through highly technical spaces.

That'd be like an artist claiming they're shakespear because they know how to autogenerate shakespeare-like art. Otherwise, I didn't seem too surprised by GPT 4.1's capability to engage with building a resume, althouhg I'm almost 100% certain that their resume would've fallen completely flat if it were not for the Deepseek Hiring manager's incapability to know an AI generated resume when they see one.
