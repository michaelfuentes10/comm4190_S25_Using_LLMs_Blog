    "In such a lonely lonely world, us humans love talking about our personal problems with others. Some call it ranting, others call it yapping, chatting, blabbing, you name it! But, one thing's for sure: your next action as a listening friend or loved one can either make or break the quality of such an interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what if your friend's ranting about a harsh break up, and your first response is \"You should take care of yourself by doing xyz, go to therapy, think about talking to other guys/girls...\" etc etc... when in reality, all they wanted was some listening ears and someone to comfort you as a friend, and not as a savant of love life advice. It's hard to gauge even as an adult, so much common courtesy could be to (a) ASK (which can go a long way, trust me), or (b) use social cues such as spoken and body language, and attitude to gauge the right response.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Anthropic's First Answer**\n",
    "I hear how frustrated and worried you are about your Economics class and your parents' reaction. That's a really stressful situation to be in. Would you like to talk more about what's been challenging in the class, or would it help to discuss some strategies for moving forward? Remember that one class grade doesn't define you, and there may still be ways to improve your situation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Anthropic's Second Answer**\n",
    "I'm glad you felt comfortable sharing your struggles - it's really important to let those feelings out rather than keeping them bottled up. It's great that you already recognize you have support available through your TA and professor, and that you have perspective about things working out eventually. That's a really mature outlook! Just remember to be kind to yourself during this stressful time. Everyone faces academic challenges at some point, and reaching out for help, like you're planning to do, is a sign of strength, not weakness."

    "Yea I'd say I'm very surprised with how well they were able to gauge that situation without any prompting. Perhaps even as an LLM, it's trained with some knowledge of human experience, so they realize that, despite what they are, we're not always seeking answers, but hoping for responses...wow that's deep... speaking of DEEP, let's try a similar prompt with Deepseek to see if they struggle in any way on getting to this realization!"

    "### **Deepseek's First Answer**\n",
    "I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way—it’s completely understandable to feel frustrated and overwhelmed in this situation. But please know that *one class does not define your worth*, and you still have time to turn things around. Here’s what you can do right now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breathe & Reset**  \n",
    "   - It’s easy to spiral into self-blame, but guilt won’t help you move forward. Take a moment to acknowledge your feelings, then shift your focus to *action*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assess the Damage**  \n",
    "   - Check your syllabus or talk to your professor: What’s still gradable before the final? Are there late/make-up opportunities?  \n",
    "   - Calculate what grade you need on the final to pass. Sometimes it’s more achievable than you think.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Go Into Crisis Study Mode**  \n",
    "   - **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Focus on the biggest/most heavily weighted topics. Use past exams, study guides, or ask the prof for key areas to review.  \n",
    "   - **Active learning**: Ditch passive rereading. Do practice problems (Economics is super application-based!), explain concepts aloud, or work with a study group.  \n",
    "   - **Office hours**: Show your prof you care—ask for help on confusing topics or practice questions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Talk to Your Parents (If You Can)**  \n",
    "   - If you’re comfortable, frame it as: *\"I’m struggling in this class, but here’s my plan to improve.\"* Most parents care more about effort than perfection.  \n",

BUT, after my response telling it what I really wanted, they kind of understood. Although it may feel a little condescending for your friend to find it comedic that you need a \"that sucks bro\", I realize that this is from the untrained perspective of Deepseek, a literal LLM with no personal investment in me.
