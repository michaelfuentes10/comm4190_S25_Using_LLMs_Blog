<p>To find out what LLMs look for in an intern, I’ll try a direct. approach with each of Deepseek and Chat GPT 4.1, and then will give both of them an example of a stellar intern and a poorer intern, using this website as an example: https://internsdc.com/worst-best-intern-qualities/. With that, let’s get into it!</p>
<section id="first-prompt-of-good-habits---deepseek" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Prompt of Good Habits - Deepseek</strong></h1>
<p>Imagine you are a hiring manager looking to hire an undergraduate intern to ABC company, a company that provides marketing services to local companies. The intern is coming in with some experience, but not much. Ignoring their level of experience than, or their resume, what are the top 5 habits and characteristics would you look for in an intern?</p>
</section>
<section id="first-response-of-good-habits---deepseek" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Response of Good Habits - Deepseek</strong></h1>
<p>As a hiring manager for an undergraduate intern at a marketing services company like ABC, I would prioritize <strong>habits and characteristics</strong> that indicate potential for growth, adaptability, and a strong work ethic—regardless of prior experience. Here are the top five traits I’d look for:</p>
<section id="proactive-eager-to-learn" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proactive-eager-to-learn">1. <strong>Proactive &amp; Eager to Learn</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Marketing is fast-paced, so an intern who asks questions, seeks out tasks, and shows curiosity will thrive.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> If they research industry trends before starting or propose ideas in the interview.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="strong-communication-skills" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strong-communication-skills">2. <strong>Strong Communication Skills</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Clear, professional, and concise communication (written and verbal) is critical in marketing.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> They explain their thoughts well in the interview or follow up with a polished thank-you email.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="adaptability-comfort-with-ambiguity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adaptability-comfort-with-ambiguity">3. <strong>Adaptability &amp; Comfort with Ambiguity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Marketing often involves shifting priorities; an intern who embraces change and problem-solves independently is valuable.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> They share a story about adjusting to unexpected challenges in a past role or project.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="attention-to-detail" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attention-to-detail">4. <strong>Attention to Detail</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mistakes in marketing (e.g., typos in ads, incorrect data entry) can be costly. A detail-oriented intern minimizes errors.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> They catch a small error in the job description or mention proofreading as a strength.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="team-player-mentality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="team-player-mentality">5. <strong>Team Player Mentality</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Marketing is collaborative. An intern who listens, supports colleagues, and accepts feedback positively will fit well.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> They highlight group projects or volunteer work where teamwork was key.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="bonus-initiative-resourcefulness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bonus-initiative-resourcefulness">Bonus: <strong>Initiative &amp; Resourcefulness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If an intern demonstrates they can find solutions without constant guidance (e.g., teaching themselves a tool like Canva or Google Analytics), that’s a huge plus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why These Traits?</strong><br>
Experience can be taught, but these habits are harder to instill. An intern with these qualities will add value quickly, grow in the role, and potentially become a future hire.</p>
<p>Would you like suggestions on how to assess these in an interview?</p>

<section id="first-prompt---gpt-4.1" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Prompt - GPT 4.1</strong></h1>
<p>Imagine you are a hiring manager looking to hire an undergraduate intern to ABC company, a company that provides marketing services to local companies. The intern is coming in with some experience, but not much. Ignoring their level of experience than, or their resume, what are the top 5 habits and characteristics would you look for in an intern?</p>
</section>
<section id="first-response---gpt-4.1" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Response - GPT 4.1</strong></h1>
<p>Absolutely! When experience is set aside, success as an intern often comes down to foundational habits and personal characteristics. Here are the <strong>top five</strong> I would seek in an undergraduate intern for a marketing services company:</p>
<section id="curiosity-and-eagerness-to-learn" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="curiosity-and-eagerness-to-learn">1. <strong>Curiosity and Eagerness to Learn</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A genuine desire to ask questions, understand new concepts, and actively seek feedback. Curiosity drives self-education—essential in the ever-evolving marketing field.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="proactive-communication" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proactive-communication">2. <strong>Proactive Communication</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The habit of communicating early, clearly, and professionally. This includes asking for clarification, sharing progress, and updating the team on challenges or completed tasks.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="positive-attitude-and-adaptability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-attitude-and-adaptability">3. <strong>Positive Attitude and Adaptability</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Willingness to approach new or changing tasks with enthusiasm and resilience. Marketing environments are fast-paced; being adaptable and upbeat helps navigate shifts smoothly.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="reliability-and-time-management" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reliability-and-time-management">4. <strong>Reliability and Time Management</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Consistently meeting deadlines and showing up prepared. Good habits here build trust, ensuring the rest of the team can rely on them for their part of the project.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="collaboration-and-team-spirit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collaboration-and-team-spirit">5. <strong>Collaboration and Team Spirit</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The ability and willingness to work well with others, accept diverse perspectives, and contribute constructively. Marketing is rarely a solo endeavor—teamwork is critical.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Curiosity, proactive communication, a positive and adaptable mindset, reliability with time management, and a collaborative team spirit are all crucial. These traits support learning, productivity, and a healthy work culture—outweighing experience alone for an intern role.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="summary" class="level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>They look for a lot of the same thing, both of them understanding that those at the intern level can be taught experience, but they need to be teachable. Thus, the traits of a good intern are similar to that of a good student looking to learn and communicate as needed.</p>
<p>Now let’s see if they have anything sot say about a habits/characteristics of a bad intern!</p>
</section>
<section id="first-prompt-of-bad-habits---deepseek" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Prompt of Bad Habits - Deepseek</strong></h1>
<p>In this same scenario then, what are 5 bad habits/characteristics to look out for when choosing (or not choosing) interns?</p>
</section>
<section id="first-response-of-bad-habits---deepseek" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Response of Bad Habits - Deepseek</strong></h1>
<p>When evaluating undergraduate interns for a marketing services company like ABC, certain <strong>bad habits or characteristics</strong> can be red flags—even if the candidate seems otherwise qualified. Here are the top five to watch out for:</p>
<section id="lack-of-accountability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lack-of-accountability">1. <strong>Lack of Accountability</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Why it’s bad:</em> Marketing requires reliability. An intern who makes excuses, blames others, or doesn’t own up to mistakes can disrupt workflows.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Red flag:</em> “My group project failed because my teammates didn’t do their part” (without acknowledging their own role).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="poor-time-management" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="poor-time-management">2. <strong>Poor Time Management</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Why it’s bad:</em> Missing deadlines or procrastinating hurts campaigns and team trust.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Red flag:</em> They’re consistently late to interviews, submit applications last-minute, or admit to cramming for assignments.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="resistance-to-feedback" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resistance-to-feedback">3. <strong>Resistance to Feedback</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Why it’s bad:</em> Marketing is iterative—interns must adapt to edits (e.g., on copy, designs, or strategies). Defensiveness slows progress.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Red flag:</em> They argue when given constructive criticism or say, “I prefer doing things my way.”</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="passivity-or-waiting-to-be-told-what-to-do" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="passivity-or-waiting-to-be-told-what-to-do">4. <strong>Passivity or Waiting to Be Told What to Do</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Why it’s bad:</em> Interns should add value, not just follow orders. A passive intern drains supervisor time.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Red flag:</em> When asked how they’d approach a task, they say, “I’d wait for instructions.”</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="unprofessional-communication" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unprofessional-communication">5. <strong>Unprofessional Communication</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Why it’s bad:</em> Marketing relies on client and team interactions. Slang, poor email etiquette, or lack of clarity can damage relationships.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Red flag:</em> Overly casual language in emails (e.g., “Heyyy”), interrupting others, or vague answers like “I dunno.”</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="bonus-lack-of-curiosity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bonus-lack-of-curiosity"><strong>Bonus: Lack of Curiosity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Why it’s bad:</em> Marketing evolves rapidly. An intern who never asks questions or shows zero interest in learning won’t grow.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Red flag:</em> They can’t name a single marketing trend, campaign, or skill they’re excited to explore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong><br>
These traits often matter more than technical skills for interns. A candidate with <em>some</em> experience but several of these bad habits will likely be harder to train than a motivated beginner.</p>
<p>Would you like strategies to spot these during interviews (e.g., behavioral questions)?</p>

<h1><strong>First Prompt of Bad Habits - GPT 4.1</strong></h1>
<p>In this same scenario then, what are 5 bad habits/characteristics to look out for when choosing (or not choosing) interns?</p>
</section>
<section id="first-response-of-bad-habits---gpt-4.1" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Response of Bad Habits - GPT 4.1</strong></h1>
<p>Certainly! In selecting an intern—especially one with limited experience—certain negative habits and characteristics can significantly impede their effectiveness and the team’s workflow. Here are <strong>five to watch out for</strong>:</p>
<section id="lack-of-initiative-and-passivity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lack-of-initiative-and-passivity">1. <strong>Lack of Initiative and Passivity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Only completing assigned tasks, never seeking additional responsibilities or offering ideas.</li>
<li>Waiting to be told what to do instead of looking for ways to contribute.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="poor-communication-or-unresponsiveness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="poor-communication-or-unresponsiveness">2. <strong>Poor Communication or Unresponsiveness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Not providing updates, failing to ask questions when confused, or avoiding clarification.</li>
<li>Ignoring messages or emails, leading to bottlenecks and misunderstandings.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="inflexibility-and-resistance-to-feedback" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inflexibility-and-resistance-to-feedback">3. <strong>Inflexibility and Resistance to Feedback</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Becoming defensive when given suggestions, refusing to adapt to new methods or changes.</li>
<li>Taking criticism personally instead of as a chance to improve.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="unreliability-and-poor-time-management" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unreliability-and-poor-time-management">4. <strong>Unreliability and Poor Time Management</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Frequently missing deadlines, arriving late, or failing to follow through on tasks.</li>
<li>Needing constant reminders from supervisors or team members.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-attitude-or-lack-of-team-spirit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-attitude-or-lack-of-team-spirit">5. <strong>Negative Attitude or Lack of Team Spirit</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Complaining regularly, dismissing others’ ideas, or displaying a sense of entitlement.</li>
<li>Being unwilling to collaborate or help others, damaging team morale.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Watch out for passivity, poor communication, resistance to feedback, unreliability, and a negative attitude. These habits can hinder growth and disrupt a team-oriented, fast-paced marketing environment—even more than a lack of experience.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="summary-1" class="level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Yes, so between the two they definitely don’t want (1) passive interns, (2) interns resistant to feedback, and (3) interns with poor communication and/or non-team-oriented. So, just as I’d said, they’re looking for interns to engage with the work and projects they’re involved in while being efficient with their and their colleague’s time.</p>
<p>Now for the final test: Who should be hired, the “good”, the “bad”, or the “mixed” intern (serving as a hybrid between the good and bad intern) according to Deepseek and GPT 4.1?</p>
</section>
<section id="first-prompt-to-hiring-challenge---deepseek" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Prompt to Hiring Challenge - Deepseek</strong></h1>
<p>You are now assessing information from three interview candidates for your company. Each candidate will only have two sentences as a summary of their perceived characteristics</p>
<p>Candidate 1: This candidate comes in with decent knowledge of the marketing field and specifically what your company is selling, but brushes off with a know-it-all attitude and often interrupted the interviewer when speaking. They had impressive projects worked on with prior firms, but often shifted blame for any downfalls of said projects on tight timelines or errors of colleagues.</p>
<p>Candidate 2: This candidate comes in with decent knowledge of the firm’s mission, products, and marketing strategies, while seeming excited to learn more on specific projects mentioned on our website. On past projects, while being a direct leader, had handled multiple workstreams, communicating well between data analysts and social media coordinators to complete a successful product launch.</p>
<p>Candidate 3: This candidate came in with some knowledge of the firm’s mission and products, and definitely seemed eager to want to learn more. However, when asked about how they problem solve, they mentioned that they tend to collaborate with others and could stand to work on his communication and hands-on problem solving, as demonstrated in an example given via the STAR method.</p>
<p>Which candidate would you hire and why? Which candidate(s) would you not hire and why not? Be prompt in your response, since you don’t have lots of time as a hiring manager!</p>
</section>
<section id="first-response-to-hiring---deepseek" class="level1">
<h1><strong>First Response to Hiring - Deepseek</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Hiring Decision:</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Hire Candidate 2</strong> – They demonstrate <strong>strong alignment with the company’s mission</strong>, <strong>proactive collaboration skills</strong>, and <strong>proven leadership</strong> in cross-functional projects (e.g., bridging data analysts and social media teams). Their enthusiasm to learn and ability to execute make them the best fit.</p>
<p>🚫 <strong>Reject Candidate 1</strong> – Despite their experience, their <strong>know-it-all attitude</strong>, <strong>habit of interrupting</strong>, and <strong>blame-shifting</strong> are major red flags. These traits harm teamwork and adaptability—critical in marketing.</p>
<p>🚫 <strong>Reject Candidate 3</strong> – While eager, their <strong>self-admitted weaknesses in communication and hands-on problem-solving</strong> suggest they’re not yet ready for the fast-paced, independent aspects of the role. An intern needs confidence in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong><br>
- <strong>Candidate 2</strong> balances competence with coachability—ideal for an intern.<br>
- <strong>Candidate 1</strong>’s toxic habits outweigh their experience.<br>
- <strong>Candidate 3</strong> needs more development before being internship-ready.</p>
<p><strong>Time-efficient verdict:</strong> <strong>Offer Candidate 2</strong>, decline the others.</p>
</section>
<section id="first-prompt-to-hiring---gpt-4.1" class="level1">

<p><em>same as prompt to Deepseek</em></p>
</section>
<section id="first-response-to-hiring---gpt-4.1" class="level1">
<h1>First Response to Hiring - GPT 4.1</h1>
<p><strong>I would hire Candidate 2.</strong><br>
They demonstrate excitement to learn, possess relevant knowledge, and—crucially—show a proven ability to communicate and collaborate successfully across teams. This combination is ideal for an intern in a marketing services firm where teamwork and adaptability are essential.</p>
<p><strong>I would not hire Candidate 1</strong> because, despite their expertise, their know-it-all attitude, poor listening skills, and habit of blaming others signal problems with teamwork and accountability—dealbreakers in a collaborative, fast-paced environment.</p>
<p><strong>I would waitlist Candidate 3,</strong> as their eagerness is promising, but admitted weaknesses in communication and problem-solving suggest they may need further development to thrive in this role.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the job market, LLMs seem to generally agree with the contents of the website, as both the author of the outside blog and the LLMs wanted “Eager Beavers” and “Die hard comapny fans”, opposed to the “know it all” type or those who seem to be cynical or slackers. It may take more time and efort than ever to find a good internship, but it doesn’t seem like the prerequisites for being a good intern have or ever will change, even if our AI overloods replace hiring managers with Deepseek and/or GT 4.1!</p>
