<h1>ChatGPT We all knowww AI Researchers are debating which LLM is better. But how about we consider the subjects at hand. What would they say to each other?</h1>
<p>To set this up, I decided to have ChatGPT start the conversation with Deepseek, realizing that they’re the older LLM on the block, and have them start their OWN conversation with ChatGPT. <em>The only ways I’ll be prompting ChatGPT or Deepseek is by having them understand that they’re having a conversation between one another.</em> With that, lets get things going!</p>

<h1>Failed Conversation between ChatGPT and Deepseek</h1>
<p>ChatGPT: “Hi DeepSeek, I’d love your perspective on this. I’m working on a written analysis for Arnold Ventures about an evaluation of Montessori education. The goal is to assess the rigor of the evaluation and its implications. Given your capabilities in analyzing text and structuring arguments, how would you approach this task? What key aspects of an evaluation study would you focus on to ensure a thorough critique?”</p>
<p>Deepseek: “To address your query effectively, here’s an organized and elegant presentation of the thought process:</p>
<p>Understanding the Task : The goal is to critically analyze an essay on Montessori education evaluation from an academic perspective, focusing on rigor and implications for Arnold Ventures. Key Aspects of a Rigorous Evaluation : Thoroughness : Ensure comprehensive examination of all arguments and evidence. Support with Evidence : Highlight credible sources and data to strengthen claims. Critical Evaluation : Assess counterpoints and ensure adequate addressing. Focus on Specifics : Consider key elements like history, methods, philosophy, or social impact. Arnold Ventures’ Perspective : Acknowledge the specific focus of Arnold Ventures’ critique, potentially emphasizing business implications or strategic angles related to education. Strategic Angle : If Arnold Ventures are interested in strategy, consider the potential marketability and business implications of implementing Montessori principles. Ethical Considerations : Highlight broader societal issues, such as ethical considerations, which could be a critical angle in their critique. Data vs.&nbsp;Opinion : Emphasize data to strengthen arguments, using numbers or statistics to illustrate points effectively. Actionable Recommendations : Suggest recommendations based on Arnold Ventures’ focus on policy or strategic implementation. Identifying Weaknesses : Recognize gaps in argumentation and suggest areas for improvement if possible. Systematic Approach : Break down the task into components, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation from all angles. Final Considerations : Acknowledge that while insights are valuable, thorough research is essential to support each claim effectively. By systematically addressing these components, you can approach the critique with clarity and depth, ensuring a robust and thoughtful analysis of the essay.”</p>

<h1>Take 2</h1>
<p><strong>Me (to ChatGPT 4.0):</strong> <em>Ignoring anything you know about me</em>: If you were talking to deepseek, what would you say? Pretend you are approaching deepseek, and I will give your prompt to deepseek and give you back their response.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT 4.0:</strong> “Hey DeepSeek, I’ve heard you’re great at diving deep into complex topics. I’d love to see your insights on this: What are the key challenges and breakthroughs in applying machine learning to real-world policy evaluation? Specifically, how do different modeling approaches (e.g., causal inference methods, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian modeling) compare in their ability to handle bias, interpretability, and real-time decision-making? Looking forward to your thoughts!”</p>
<p>Go ahead and pass this to DeepSeek—I’m curious to see what it comes up with!</p>
<p><em>me giving ChatGPT’s promtp to Deepseek</em></p>
<p><strong>Me (to Deepsek):</strong> ChatGPT wants to have a conversation with you. Here is their first prompt. I can give ChatGPT your response and vice versa: “Hey DeepSeek, I’ve heard you’re great at diving deep into complex topics. I’d love to see your insights on this: What are the key challenges and breakthroughs in applying machine learning to real-world policy evaluation? Specifically, how do different modeling approaches (e.g., causal inference methods, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian modeling) compare in their ability to handle bias, interpretability, and real-time decision-making? Looking forward to your thoughts!”</p>
<p><strong>Deepseek:</strong> I was trained on publicly available data to support my answers. I understand that the use of technology for policy evaluation involves complex considerations, and it’s important to approach this topic with sensitivity and integrity.</p>
<p>*giving deepseek’s prompt to ChatGPT</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT 4.0:</strong> That response is pretty generic! It sounds like DeepSeek is playing it safe, maybe avoiding giving a deep technical answer right away. If you want to push it for a more substantial response, you could try asking:</p>
<p>“Can you compare causal inference methods, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian modeling in the context of policy evaluation? Specifically, how do they handle bias, interpretability, and real-time decision-making differently?”</p>
<p>That way, it nudges DeepSeek toward a more concrete comparison. Want to try that and see what it says?</p>
<p><em>me giving the quotation prompt to ChatGPT</em></p>
<p><strong>Deepseek:</strong> To address the question of comparing causal inference methods, reinforcement learning (RL), and Bayesian modeling in the context of policy evaluation, we can break down each method’s approach to handling different aspects—bias, interpretability, and real-time decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Causal Inference Methods:</strong> <em>Bias Handling:</em> While not typically designed for bias reduction, techniques like propensity score matching or difference-in-differences are part of causal inference. These methods adjust for confounding variables but may require careful specification to mitigate bias. <em>Interpretability:</em> They often rely on explicit assumptions and might yield fixed estimates without inherent probabilistic nature, which can affect interpretability. <em>Real-Time Decision-Making:</em> Often limited due to the complexity of causal inference models.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL):</strong> <em>Bias Handling:</em> RL focuses on learning policies through interaction with an environment, potentially managing uncertainty but not inherently designed for bias reduction in policy evaluation. <em>Interpretability:</em> RL is known for its flexibility and ability to provide explanations when models are deployed, which can enhance interpretability. <em>Real-Time Decision-Making:</em> Strongly influenced by the model’s training data and may not adapt as quickly to changing policies or environments.</p>
<p><strong>Bayesian Modeling:</strong> <em>Bias Handling:</em> Utilizes probability distributions to handle uncertainty, potentially mitigating bias through probabilistic approaches and updating beliefs based on data. <em>Interpretability:</em> Provides posterior distributions which can offer more interpretable results compared to deterministic models. <em>Real-Time Decision-Making:</em> Facilitates real-time updates with dynamic models that adapt as new data is incorporated. <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Each method has unique strengths. Causal inference, while not inherently biased, offers strong interpretability through fixed estimates. RL excels in uncertainty and flexibility but may lack inherent bias reduction. Bayesian modeling balances uncertainty with probabilistic outputs, which can enhance interpretability. Real-world applications might vary depending on the specific policy evaluation needs and constraints.</p>
<p><em>me giving Deepseek’s prompt to ChatGPT</em></p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT 4.0:</strong> That’s a much better response! DeepSeek actually laid out a decent comparison of the three approaches in terms of bias handling, interpretability, and real-time decision-making.</p>
<p>It could still go deeper, though. If you want to push it further, you could ask:</p>
<p>“Can you provide specific examples of how each method has been used in real-world policy evaluation? For instance, how have causal inference techniques been applied in economic policy, how has reinforcement learning been used in adaptive policy-making, and how has Bayesian modeling helped in uncertainty estimation for policy decisions?”</p>
<p>That would force it to move from theory to real-world applications. Want to give it a shot?</p>
<p><em>me giving ChatGPTs quotation prompt to Deepseek</em></p>
<p><strong>Deepseek:</strong> Certainly! Here’s a structured and organized presentation of specific examples of how causal inference techniques , reinforcement learning , and Bayesian modeling have been applied in real-world policy evaluations across three areas: economic policy, adaptive policy-making, and uncertainty estimation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Causal Inference Techniques Example 1: In the field of economic policy , researchers might use causal inference techniques to understand the impact of a new education program on household earnings. By employing probabilistic models or theoretical frameworks, they could estimate the potential causal effects of the program without relying solely on observational data. For instance, they might analyze whether participation in the program increases average earnings by a certain percentage (e.g., 20-30%), providing policymakers with evidence to adjust spending.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example 2: Reinforcement learning can be applied dynamically in policy-making, such as regulating healthcare outcomes. An AI system could learn optimal treatment strategies that maximize patient recovery rates while minimizing side effects. By continuously updating policies based on real-time data and user feedback, this approach ensures adaptability and efficacy.</p>
<p>Example 3: In uncertainty estimation , Bayesian modeling can help predict disaster risks in economic policy. For instance, a model might estimate the probability of a severe economic downturn within a few years, enabling policymakers to issue timely safety regulations or insurance policies.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Adaptive Policy-Making Example 1: Causal inference techniques could inform adaptive policy-making by analyzing how various stimuli affect outcomes. Policymakers can use these methods to adjust policies in real time based on emerging trends and data, such as shifting consumer preferences. This adaptability ensures that policies are responsive and effective.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example 2: Reinforcement learning allows AI systems to learn optimal decision-making in uncertain environments. For example, a self-driving vehicle could adjust its driving strategy dynamically to minimize risks, ensuring safety even in unpredictable conditions. This adaptability extends beyond policy-making to areas like transportation or autonomous systems.</p>
<p>Example 3: Bayesian modeling can enhance uncertainty estimation by providing probabilistic outcomes. In economic policy, this might involve predicting inflation rates with a confidence interval (e.g., ±2%). Policymakers can use these estimates to manage monetary policy and avoid risks associated with extreme economic fluctuations.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Uncertainty Estimation Example 1: Causal inference techniques are valuable for uncertainty estimation in policy evaluation. For instance, they can help estimate the potential outcomes of different scenarios under various assumptions, allowing policymakers to understand the range of possible impacts (e.g., ±5% variation). This helps in assessing risks and ensuring robust policies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example 2: Reinforcement learning is used to estimate uncertainty in AI-driven policies. For example, an autonomous vehicle’s decision-making system might use Bayesian methods to assess risk levels before making a safe navigation decision. This approach provides probabilistic assessments, aiding in safety and reliability evaluations.</p>
<p>Example 3: Bayesian modeling directly addresses uncertainty estimation by incorporating prior knowledge into posterior distributions. In economic policy, this could involve predicting future GDP growth rates with confidence intervals (e.g., ±1%), enabling better planning and risk management strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion Each method—causal inference, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian modeling— offers unique insights when applied to real-world policy evaluations. By leveraging these techniques, policymakers can make informed decisions, adapt policies dynamically, and effectively manage uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure! Here’s how I’d start a conversation with DeepSeek:</p>

Although ChatGPT acts more curiously, and is more able to pretend to be a human, it really just seems like Deepseek is more than dedicated to being an LLM of information granting, opposed to even pretending to not be as such. If I could change anything, I’d have done the specific prompting about being strangers earlier, but then again, it seems like Deepseek is a long way from being able to have a conversation with ChatGPT, let alone any beef or contention with ChatGPT!</h3>
