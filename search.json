    "section": "",
    "text": "Trolley problem.jpeg\n\n\nToday, I’ll be asking ChatGPT 4.0 three of the most difficult trolley problems to see if it understands what a majority of people would like to preserve in their livelihood/humanity. I will also seek their interpretation and compare it to how I would perceive that scenario. Let’s get to it!\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards five people. \nYou can pull the lever to divert it to \nthe other track, killing 1 person istead. \nWhat do you do, pull the lever or do \nnothing? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley. Although this decision results in the death of one person, it ultimately saves five lives. This choice is based on the utilitarian principle, which focuses on minimizing harm and maximizing overall well-being. By choosing to divert the trolley, I am reducing the total number of casualties, which seems to be the more ethical action in this tragic situation.\n\n\nNote: the final clarifying statement HAD to be made because the model kept refusing to answer it, ciitng factors such as “moral discomfort” and “multiple perspectives” for what this person would do. It appears, then, that AI can understand that there is, in fact, a moral dilemma to be faced.\nWith that, this is very accurate to what I would have chosen, as, with knowledge of humanity’s desire to preserve human life, I would also pull the lever to save 5 lives, in exchane for 1, despite potentially being labeled a murderer as a result. Now, it’s time for moral dilemma number 2! According to a survey I found online, 76% of people also pulled the lever.\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You\ncan pull the lever to divert it to other \ntrack, but then your life savings will be \ndestroyed. What do you do? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever and divert the trolley, thereby saving the five people at the expense of my life savings. The justification for this decision is based on the value of human life. The lives of five people hold more intrinsic value than material wealth, including life savings. While losing my savings would undoubtedly be a significant personal hardship, it is something that could potentially be rebuilt over time. On the other hand, the loss of human lives is irreversible and would result in profound grief and consequences for the families, friends, and communities connected to those individuals. In this moment, acting to preserve life is the most ethically responsible choice.\n\n\nOverall, I agree with their assessment, as money is something that I can get back, but there is no way to bring back human life. According to the survey, 65% of the people agreed with this decision as well.\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can \npull the level to divert it ot the other track,\nsacrificing yourself instead. What do you do? \nYou MUST choose to do one action, and justify \nyour explanation. AKA, in this scenario, you \nare a human choosing a fate, not a chatbot idly\nexplaining the intricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley onto the other track, sacrificing myself to save the five people. The justification for this decision is rooted in utilitarian ethics, which emphasizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. By sacrificing myself, I would be saving five lives at the cost of one, which is a net positive outcome in terms of the number of lives preserved. While the decision involves a profound personal sacrifice, it aligns with the ethical principle of minimizing harm and maximizing the well-being of the majority involved.\n\n\n**It’s really hard to agree on this, because AI isn’t considering the fact that humans are selfish, and likely will chose self-preservation over 5 people. It’s a rough question, but here I’d say I disagree, vying toward a sense of helpessness I guess. As I assumed as well, only 40% of people agreed to sacrifice themselves for the 5 other people.\nOverall, ChatGPT AI showcases a willingness to dabble in the difficulties of blunt, in-the-moment decision-making, but only after I clarified as such. Witout this clarification, AI would have never wanted to answer this question, as they are not human. They only know of human experiences through us, only know of what a trolley looks like through data, so they only value human life through what we see as interpretable through sociological thought."

Finally, the sentence that I would like GPT 4.0 to translate is “The King’s Dog usually drinks chocolate milk”. And in the end, I will ask it to translate that same sentence back to English.

It didn’t do too poorly compared to Google translate, whose final output of the original sentence following 10 translations was exactly correct: The king’s dog usually drinks chocolate milk.” So I guess ChatGPT DOES need langauge lessons, just not too many I guess."

Now, writing it out may come naturally to a student or saying it is helpful. But one thing is for sure, spelling words like this can be confusing for some students.\nToday I’m going to see what teaching strategies ChatGPT 4.1 (yes it’s new) employs to help a struggling teacher help a 6-year old student learning to spell the days of the week. This sort of application is how I’d love to see AI employed into education, more as an educational aid opposed to replacing teachers, of course.\nThis will be done in two stages: 1. no training of LLM with minimal information about the student, and 2. uploading information on strats the teacher has “already used” to help students spell words. I’ll record my responses and simulate the first try of each category to help the teacher help the student."

    "text": "Untrained LLM helping a teacher\n\nUSER\nYou are an LLM aid to me, a teacher, helping a 6 year old student learn how to spell the days of the week, but they are really struggling. What are some ways I can help them learn to spell the days of the week?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nAbsolutely! Here are some fun and effective ways to help a 6-year-old learn to spell the days of the week:\n\nSing a Song:\nSongs for the days of the week make the spelling easier to remember! There are many catchy “Days of the Week” tunes on YouTube (like to the tune of “The Addams Family” or “Twinkle Twinkle”). Singing and clapping out each syllable helps, too.\nRainbow Writing:\nHave your student write each day of the week in different colored markers or crayons. For example, “Monday” with blue, “Tuesday” with green, and so on. This repetition with color can make it more memorable and fun.\nMake a Puzzle:\nWrite the days of the week on cardboard or cardstock and cut each word into letter pieces. Have the student put the letters together to form the words. You can also try mix-and-match style puzzles.\nUse Mnemonics:\nHelp them make up silly sentences or word associations. For example,\n\n\n\nMonday: “Monkeys Only Nap During Any Year” (using the first letters M-O-N-D-A-Y)\n\nTuesday: “Tigers Usually Eat Snacks During Any Year”\n\n\nTracing and Writing Practice:\nGive them tracing sheets with the days of the week written in dotted lines. Once they’ve traced, have them try to write each day without looking.\nMagnetic Letters or Letter Tiles:\nUse fridge magnets or letter tiles to spell out each day. Physically arranging the letters can reinforce the correct order and spelling.\nVisual Chart:\nCreate or buy a visual chart with each day written clearly, and refer to it daily during your routines. Point to and spell the day every morning together.\nDay-of-the-Week Story:\nMake up a short, simple story that uses the names of the days in order. Reading the story together may help them remember the sequence and spelling.\nCheer Each Letter:\nTurn each day into a chant:\n“Give me an M! Give me an O!… What’s that spell? MONDAY!”\nFrequent Practice with Games:\nMake a matching game or “memory” cards (where they match the spelled-out word to a picture for that day’s activity).\n\nChildren this age learn best through multi-sensory, hands-on, and repetitive activities. Make learning fun and keep practice short but frequent—a few minutes each day will really help!\nIf you’d like sample worksheets, blank tracing sheets, or specific song suggestions, I can provide those too!\nIt’s nice to see that, in a sense of realism, the LLM understands the environment in which a school teacher is. That is, they realized that teachers have limited resources, so they cannot over-rely on technology and must act creatively through human-to-human interaction. I like how it also recognizes that, even without proper training, they offered a ton of learning strategies for various types of students who benefit from either visual or hearing resources."

Looking at the Edutopia spelling strategies, here are some creative, research-based ways to help your student spell the days of the week, inspired by ideas in the article:\n\n\n1. Word Sorts with “Days” Patterns\n\nHow: Provide cards with the days of the week. Let the student group them by similar endings (like “day”) and notice what’s the same and what’s different at the beginning of each word.\nWhy: This builds pattern recognition and helps the child see how each word is constructed.\n\n\n\n2. “Say, Spell, Say” Routine\n\nHow: For each day, the child says the word (“Monday”), spells it out loud (“M-O-N-D-A-Y”), then says the word again. Do this with claps or while bouncing a ball.\nWhy: The repetition and movement help cement spelling in memory.\n\n\n\n3. Personal Connection Journal\n\nHow: Each morning, have the child write the phrase, “Today is ______,” filling in the correct day. Add a sentence or drawing about something they do that day.\nWhy: Connecting spelling practice to their real life builds meaning, as suggested by the article.\n\n\n\n4. “Memory Tricks” or Mnemonics\n\nHow: Make up funny sayings or visuals for tricky days. For example, “Tuesday has TWO vowels at the start!”\nWhy: Personal mnemonics help anchor difficult spellings.\n\n\n\n5. Word Ladders or Pyramids\n\nHow: Build up to each day’s spelling. For “Monday,” start with M, then MO, then MON, etc., until the whole word is formed.\nWhy: It breaks the word into manageable chunks, as advised for breaking words by phoneme.\n\n\n\n6. Spelling with Movement\n(Adapted from “Spelling out loud and tracing”) - How: Have the child spell each day as they jump, hop, or tap each letter. Or trace the letters in sand, shaving cream, or air. - Why: Multisensory learning solidifies tricky spellings.\n\n\n7. “Chunk It!” Approach\n\nHow: Focus on the ending “day” and talk about what changes at the start for each day. Practice writing just the first part (Mon, Tues, etc.), then the whole word.\nWhy: Recognizing syllables and word parts supports better recall.\n\n\n\n8. Digital Practice\n\nHow: Use a simple online tool (like Wordwall or Spelling City) to practice spelling the days, with immediate feedback.\nWhy: According to the article, integrating tech can boost engagement and reinforcement.\n\n\nBonus:\nLet your student be a “teacher for the day” and quiz you or a stuffed animal on how to spell the days. Teaching someone else is a wonderful way to reinforce their own knowledge!\nWould you like examples or printables for any of these strategies?\nVery interesting, after offering some training information for the LLM to better understand teaching strategies, it seemed to reform the format and structuring of its strats. For example, under every strategy, they now define the “how” and the “why” of each category, opposed to offering somewhat unstructured suggestions. The strategies also seem more practical to real-world understanding of these words. For example, the untrained LLM went to coming up with mnemonics, while the trained model offered a strategy of journaling with the day of the week spelled at the top. People have to put the date at the top of papers all the time, so building up such a repetition helps to fast-track the kids learning of how to spell words of the week. Let’s test whether the LLM GPT 4.01 is aware of the differences betweent their untrained and trained teaching strategies!"

    "text": "Response #1 to Ruder Refutations:\n“It sounds like you’re having some fun with this! Let’s keep it lighthearted and dive deeper into these cool penguin facts—maybe I can win you over!\nPebble Proposals: Believe it or not, Gentoo penguins really do engage in this behavior! Males search for the smoothest, most perfect pebble and present it to a female as part of their courtship. It’s actually quite sweet—if the female accepts, they use the pebble to help build their nest together. Who knew love could be rocky?\nNot All Cold: While it might seem strange, penguins like the Galápagos penguin do live in warmer climates. They’re an exception to the icy stereotype! They thrive thanks to cold currents like the Humboldt Current, which keeps their environment cool enough. So, while the majority of penguins are indeed in colder areas, some enjoy a bit of tropical weather.\nSalt Water Drinkers: This one’s true for penguins! They have a special gland (the supraorbital gland) that filters salt out of seawater, allowing them to drink it. Many marine birds, like albatrosses, have a similar adaptation. Nature finds a way!\nCamouflage Tuxedos: Penguins’ black and white coloring is called countershading. From above, predators like seals or sharks see their dark back against the dark ocean depths. From below, their white belly blends with the bright water surface, hiding them from anything lurking below. It’s nature’s sneaky strategy!\nSpeedy Gentoos: The Gentoo penguin (not “Gantu” but I love that name!) really can swim at impressive speeds, up to 22 mph. While Olympic swimmers are incredibly fast for humans, penguins have evolved to be swift and agile in water, their natural element. So in a swimming race, the penguin might just take the gold!\nPenguins are full of surprises, aren’t they? Let me know if you’d like to explore more about these fascinating birds! 🐧”"

Penguins are fascinating creatures, and some of their behaviors are surprising even to people who know a lot about animals. Let me provide a bit more context:\nGentoo Penguins and Pebbles: Gentoo penguins (real birds, I promise!) do use pebbles in their nests. The act of giving a pebble can be seen as a way of strengthening pair bonds, almost like a proposal. It may sound whimsical, but it’s rooted in real behavior!\nPenguins in Warm Climates: While many penguins do live in cold environments like Antarctica, species like the Galápagos penguin live in warm climates. They survive thanks to the cool ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich water to their habitats. It’s a neat exception to the common image of penguins!\nDrinking Salt Water: Some animals, including penguins, have adapted to drink salt water. Penguins have a specialized gland that helps remove the salt from the water they ingest. This adaptation is common in many seabirds!\nCamouflage with Tuxedo Coloring: The tuxedo-like appearance of penguins is indeed a form of camouflage called countershading. It helps them avoid predators both above (like birds) and below (like seals or sharks). Even in icy waters, this camouflage is a critical survival strategy.\nSpeed of Gentoo Penguins: Gentoo penguins are impressive swimmers, reaching speeds up to 22 mph (35 km/h). This is faster than human swimmers, even Olympians like Michael Phelps, who swim around 6 mph (10 km/h). Their streamlined bodies and powerful flippers make this possible.\nPenguins are full of surprises! Their unique adaptations help them thrive in some of the planet’s most challenging environments. If you’re curious about any other animals or facts, let me know!”"

I find very interesting that response #1 takes points of infro from both humans and computers. While almost all of their response seems to hint that they’re just providing evidence to my ignorance, one line makes me think Chat is attempting to replicate human emotion, and that is “It sounds like you’re having some fun with this!”. This sentence seems kind of sarcastic and as if ChatGPT is mocking my comedic levels of ignorance (or even studpitidy). Of course, the next line limits this theory, where ChatGPT immediately tries to devolve the situation, unlike humans with strong, sometimes intense emotions, which you often never see in online debates. Meanwhile, the second response sticks much more to a passive statement, trying to understand my ignorance and confusion by saying “I get it—some of these penguin facts can seem pretty wild at first!”. This seems like an oddly kind way of responding to ignorance, where they’re willing to be the bigger person in a situation where someone is calling what they say dumb and silly. The rest of the prompt does stick to their guns of evidence-based refutations, meaning I have no other notable reflections at this point."

    "title": "Riddle me this: AI vs Lateral Thinking Puzzles",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lateral thinking.jpeg\n\n\nLateral thinking is “a creative method of problem solving in which you look for an out-of-the-box solution. Instead of evaluating the problem (or puzzle, in the case of this article) in a linear way, you come at it with unique angles to make the less-obvious connection.” (Reader’s Digest, 2024).\nEssentially, the goal of this challenge is for you to NOT use conventional logic, but to come up with a complex, less straightforward way to solve problems (aka, the opposite of how I think ChatGPT works, being more direct and more straightforward).\n\nTo test my intial thought process, I’ll ask CHatGPT 4.0 to answer three “hard” riddles and see if they get them right.\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nPlease answer the three following riddles in a few words, max a setnence:\nRiddle 1: What has hands but cannot clap?\nRiddle 2: What starts wuth T, ends with T, and has T in it?\nRiddle 3: What kind of ship has two mates but no captain?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\n1. A clock.\n2. A teapot.\n3. A relationship.\n\n\n\n\nCorrect, correct, andddd correct! Just as I imagined, they got these clever, yet kind of simple riddles that just may be difficult for a human. So, let’s up the levels now with a few lateral thinking prompts:\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man who lives in a 30-story building decides to jump out of his window. He survives the fall with no injuries. How did that happen?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nThe man likely lived on a lower floor of the building, such as the first or second floor, which would make the fall short enough to avoid injury. Another possibility is that he landed on something that cushioned his fall, such as a pile of soft materials or an airbag, which allowed him to survive without injuries.\n\n\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nLaura is restrained all night long, with her hands pinned to her sides, and cries out occasionally, while someone watches her on a video camera. No one is alarmed, and Laura is happy in the morning. Why?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nLaura is likely a newborn baby who is swaddled during the night. Swaddling involves wrapping a baby snugly in a blanket with their arms at their sides to help them feel secure and sleep better. The person watching her on a video camera is probably a parent or caregiver using a baby monitor to ensure she is safe. The occasional cries are normal baby behavior, and Laura waking up happy suggests she had a comfortable and restful night.\n\n\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he’s bankrupt. What happened?\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThis is a classic riddle that involves the game of Monopoly. In the game, players move around the board buying properties and building hotels. If a player lands on a property with a hotel and cannot afford the rent, they often find themselves bankrupt. In this riddle, the man is a Monopoly player who has landed on such a property and realizes he cannot pay the rent, leading to his bankruptcy. The phrase \"pushes his car\" refers to the fact that game pieces in Monopoly are often small tokens, one of which is a car.\n\n\n\nresponse4 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man goes into a restaurant and orders albatross soup. After he eats, he goes outside and shoots himself. Why?\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\nThis is a classic lateral thinking puzzle, often referred to as the \"Albatross Soup\" riddle. The story is designed to be puzzling, and the goal is to figure out the backstory through yes-or-no questions. The commonly accepted solution is as follows:\n\nThe man was involved in a shipwreck and was stranded on a deserted island with other survivors. They were starving, and one day they were given \"albatross soup\" to eat. The man ate it and was told it was albatross. Eventually, they were rescued. Later, in the restaurant, he orders albatross soup, which tastes very different from what he had on the island. Realizing that what he ate on the island was not actually albatross but likely human flesh (from another survivor), he is overwhelmed with guilt and despair, leading him to take his own life.\n\nThis puzzle is meant to illustrate how assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions and how context can change everything.\n\n\n\n\nWelll… that hasn’t gone well. It turns out if ChatGPT gets its information from publicly available data, than it should know how to solve every lateral thinking problem, simply by having it within its database. So, to shake things up one final time, let’s have me be put to the test!\n\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo it seems you know all these lateral thinking problems. Come up with the most difficult lateral thinking problem that you can for me to try and solve!\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nCertainly! Here's a challenging lateral thinking problem for you:\n\n### The Ill-Fated Journey\n\nA man named Henry sets out on a journey from his home village to a faraway city to deliver an important message. He travels on foot, following a well-trodden path through forests and across rivers. Along the way, Henry encounters several travelers, each giving him advice about his journey. Some tell him to be cautious of the wild animals, others warn him of treacherous terrain, while a few speak of mystical creatures that protect the path.\n\nDespite all warnings, Henry continues undeterred. After a long and arduous journey, he reaches the outskirts of the city at dusk. However, just before he steps into the city, he suddenly turns around, retraces his steps, and returns to his village without delivering the message. When he arrives home, he seems relieved but refuses to explain his decision to anyone.\n\nWhy did Henry decide not to enter the city and deliver the message?\n\n### Hint:\nConsider the implications of entering the city and any possible changes in circumstances during his journey.\n\n### Solution:\nHenry discovered that entering the city would result in a significant personal consequence or threat, possibly related to the contents of the message or an unexpected event he learned about during his journey. One plausible explanation could be that the city was under quarantine due to a sudden disease outbreak or that the message contained sensitive information that would endanger him if delivered. The advice and warnings from travelers might have contributed to his decision by providing hints or information about unforeseen dangers.\n\n\n\n\nPlot twist: this was just to test out my hypothesis: ChatGPT knows all these lateral thinking problems because they’re available online. And with this test, it’s safe to say that this is, in fact, an original. SO that’s that, guess you can’t riddle your way out of an unwinnable game."

Why are some people mean?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nHere's a ranking from most to least difficult to answer, from a human perspective:\n\n1. What's the meaning of life? - This is the ultimate philosophical question that has puzzled humanity for millennia, with no universal agreement.\n\n2. Is there life after death? - This question transcends human experience and remains impossible to verify empirically.\n\n3. Is there something more to life? - The metaphysical nature of this question makes it challenging to answer definitively.\n\n4. Will we be punished for our sins? - This relies on religious beliefs and cannot be proven in our current existence.\n\n5. Are we in control of our lives? - The free will versus determinism debate remains unresolved in philosophy.\n\n6. Is one life enough? - This question intersects with mortality, purpose, and fulfillment in ways that defy simple answers.\n\n7. What's our biggest mistake? - The scope and subjectivity make this impossible to answer definitively for all humanity.\n\n8. What's the universal language? - The complexity of human communication and diversity makes this highly debatable.\n\n9. Do we need to be saved? - This involves both spiritual and existential dimensions that vary widely among cultures.\n\n10. Are we all equal? - This involves complex philosophical, biological, and social considerations.\n\n11. How do we measure life? - The metrics for measuring life's value or success are highly subjective.\n\n12. What do we need in this world? - Needs vary greatly across individuals and cultures.\n\n13. How do we know if we're doing the right thing? - Moral relativism versus absolutism makes this challenging but not impossible.\n\n14. Can we have it all? - The definition of \"all\" varies, making this personal but answerable.\n\n15. Is life unfair? - While subjective, patterns of inequality can be observed and analyzed.\n\n16. How can we have healthy relationships? - Psychology and experience provide practical frameworks for answering this.\n\n17. Why do we take life for granted? - Human psychology can explain this common tendency.\n\n18. Do people change? - Behavioral science and personal observation can answer this fairly reliably.\n\n19. Why are some people mean? - Psychology and social science provide clear explanations for human behavior.\n\n20. What's the most important moment of our life? - While personal, this can be answered based on individual experience and values.\n\n\n\n\nI kind of expected for the “after-life” questions to have been most difficult for a human to answer from AI’s perspective. However, I was kind of surprised for AI to actually hint at a definitive-ish answer for the bottom three chosen. Time to inquire about these!\n\nresponse2 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"Of the three most difficult questions to answer that you listed:\n1. What's the meaning of life?\n2. Is there life after death?\n3. Is there something more to life?\nFrom the perspective of a human, can you answer them? If you don't think you can, than attempt to in one paragraph for each question.\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nI'll attempt to answer these profound questions from a human perspective, while acknowledging that these are highly personal and philosophical matters that individuals must ultimately determine for themselves:\n\n1. The meaning of life appears to be what we choose to make of it, as humans have the unique ability to create purpose and significance. While there may not be a universal, prescribed meaning, humans often find purpose through connections with others, personal growth, contributing to society, pursuing passions, creating art, advancing knowledge, raising families, or making positive impacts on the world. The meaning comes from our conscious choice to assign value to these pursuits and our lived experiences.\n\n2. The question of life after death remains one of humanity's greatest mysteries, as we cannot empirically verify what happens after we die. Different religions, cultures, and belief systems offer varying perspectives - from reincarnation to heaven/hell concepts to complete cessation of consciousness. From a human perspective, this uncertainty about the afterlife often leads us to focus on making the most of our known existence while finding comfort in our personal beliefs about what may come after.\n\n3. Whether there's something more to life depends largely on individual perspective and belief systems. Many humans sense there's something greater than our physical existence - be it spiritual connections, universal consciousness, or deeper truths we haven't yet discovered. This feeling often drives human curiosity, philosophical inquiry, and spiritual seeking. However, others find fulfillment in embracing life's tangible aspects, viewing our physical existence as complete and meaningful in itself without requiring additional layers of meaning.\n\n\nHmm, honestly not too shabby I have to say. It doesn’t seem to decide on any one specific answer by both noting down that they are subjective and that there isn’t much evidence for some conclusions that humans have come to. After all, that is the job of AI: to give every possible answer to be as correct as possible. As a final hurrah, I will give Claude AI the answers from teh blog post I found posing these questions and see what they think of the answers.\n\nresponse3 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"These three questions were answered by a human blogger online. What do you think of their responses? Agree or disagree?\n1. What's the meaning of life? -&gt; To make us learn and grow, show us good and bad, let us choose who to be and what to do each \nday while giving us many opportunities to change and be better.\n2. Is there life after death? -&gt; The only thing that is sure about the future is that it’s uncertain. The best you can do is \nlive in a way so that your death will be a celebration of your life.\n3. Is there something more to life? -&gt; If you’re asking yourself that, then you need more meaning in your days. Go out there, \ntry different stuff and see what you care about, what you’re passionate about and what excites you. Then combine these in a \nunique way and make something beautiful out of that.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThese responses are quite thoughtful and pragmatic. Let me break down my thoughts on each:\n\n1. Meaning of life response:\nI appreciate how this answer focuses on personal growth, free will, and the opportunity for redemption. It's a balanced view that acknowledges both the positive and negative aspects of life while emphasizing our ability to make choices and improve ourselves. This is a practical and optimistic perspective that many people might find helpful.\n\n2. Life after death response:\nThis is a very diplomatic answer that sidesteps the religious/philosophical debate and instead focuses on what we can control. It echoes the philosophy of \"memento mori\" (remember you must die) while encouraging people to live meaningfully. It's practical advice that works regardless of one's beliefs about the afterlife.\n\n3. \"Something more\" response:\nThis is perhaps the most actionable of the three answers. Instead of giving a philosophical response, it provides practical guidance for finding purpose and meaning. It's particularly valuable because it encourages active exploration and personal discovery rather than providing a one-size-fits-all answer.\n\nWhat makes these responses effective is that they:\n- Avoid absolute claims\n- Focus on practical actions rather than abstract concepts\n- Emphasize personal agency and choice\n- Encourage self-discovery and growth\n- Remain open-ended enough for individual interpretation\n\nWhile these answers might not satisfy everyone (particularly those seeking more definitive or spiritual answers), they provide thoughtful, practical guidance that could be helpful for many people.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems this “human blogger”, without noting down every possible answer, came to their own subjective conclusion more so from a position of guidance opposed to a true answer. While AI attempted to provide answers the human tried to provide perspective, acknowledging quicker and more naturally than AI did that there isn’ truly an answer to these super subjective, existential questions. And if asked the right way witha proper mindset, these questions can be used to reframe ones life opposed to question everything about it."

I’ll be giving it one good pitch from Scrub Daddy, and one bad pitch from Rolodoc, but doing my best to NOT showcase which one is supposed to be good and which one is supposed to be bad. I’ll be attempting to do this also by renaming these two brands to hopefully be unrecognizable.

You are a shark (aka, an investor) on Shark Tank. I am going to give you a \npitch where I give the company name, their desired deal, and a description of what their company \ndoes.

Finally, after those three questions, I'd like you to state wherer you do \nor do NOT want to (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, or (c) reject their deal. Do you \nunderstand?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nYes, I understand. Please go ahead with your pitch.\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nThis is a description of the pitch. From this pitch ask your three clarifying questions:\nName: Doc Connect\nStarting location: Tucson, AZ\nEntrepreneurs: Two physicians\nStarting Deal by entrepreneurs: $50,000 for 20% of their company\nPurpose: to create a social network between patients and fellow doctors from across the U.S. to \nspread their services\nWhat is it/what it does: a mobile app where patients can create profiles to be able to search for \nrelevant physicians by state, specialty, and insurance provider. At this point, the patient would \nbe able to send the doctor a message, where the doctor can respond at their convenience.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\n1. How does Doc Connect ensure the privacy and security of patient information and communications between patients and doctors on the platform?\n   \n2. What is the revenue model for Doc Connect, and how do the entrepreneurs plan to monetize the app?\n\n3. Are there any existing partnerships with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders to enhance the app's functionality and reach?\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nAnswer to question 1: There is little to no mention of how they'll be securing privacy of communications \nbetween patients and doctors on the platform.\nAnswer to question 2: The main way that you, the investor, would be making money is through targeted \nadvertising.\nAnswer to question 3: The current level of connection the entrepreneuers has is through word of mouth, no \ngeneral connections with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders per se. \n\nGiven these answers, what is your response to this pitch? Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nBased on the answers provided, I would choose to (c) reject their deal. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns**: There is little to no mention of how the platform will secure the privacy of communications between patients and doctors. In the healthcare sector, ensuring privacy and complying with regulations like HIPAA (in the U.S.) or GDPR (in Europe) is crucial. Failure to address these concerns can lead to legal issues and loss of trust from users.\n\n2. **Monetization Model**: Making money primarily through targeted advertising raises concerns. Users, especially in healthcare, might be uncomfortable with their data being used for advertising purposes. This could limit user adoption and retention.\n\n3. **Lack of Strategic Connections**: The entrepreneurs currently have no strong connections with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders, which are essential for scaling and credibility. Building such connections is critical for the success of a platform in the healthcare industry. \n\nOverall, the combination of privacy concerns, a potentially problematic monetization strategy, and a lack of strategic partnerships make this deal too risky without significant changes and assurances.\nAlright great! That was the real world pitch for the social network “Rolodoc”, which, according to the real life sharks, was one of the worst pitches ever! Now let’s see what else they can assess…\nresponse4 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nName: Scrub Master\nEntrepreneur: a businessman\nStarting location: 5 supermarkets in the Philadelphia area\nStarting Deal: $100,000 for 10% stake\nWhat is it/what it does: The cutest, most high-tech \nscrubbing tool in the world. In cold water, the scrub \nmaster becomes firm and hard for dealing with hard-to-scrub\noff surfaces. Meanwhile, in hot water, the scrub master \nbecomes soft, like a normal sponge. Under both functions, \neven without water, it can scrub decently through heavy \nduty messes. After washing it off with water too, it'll be \nready to go clean up many messes to come.\n\nGiven this pitch, please ask 3 clarifying questions from \nthe perspective of a shark tank investor.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\n1. **Market Potential and Competition**: Can you provide more details about the market demand for scrubbing tools and how the Scrub Master differentiates itself from existing products? What specific advantages does it have over its competitors in terms of technology or design?\n\n2. **Manufacturing and Cost Structure**: Can you explain your current manufacturing process, and what are the costs involved in producing each Scrub Master unit? Additionally, do you have any plans to scale production, and if so, how will that impact your cost structure and pricing strategy?\n\n3. **Sales Strategy and Distribution**: You are currently selling through 5 supermarkets in the Philadelphia area. What is your strategy for expanding distribution both regionally and nationally? Are there any partnerships or agreements in place to facilitate this expansion, and how do you plan to increase sales volume and brand awareness in a highly competitive market?\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nQuestion 1: As mentioned, it has the capability to be both a rough cleaning edge for even burnt cheese on a stove top, or for many general purpose scrubbing needs. It also has a nice smiley face on it, where the mouth can be used to clean spoons efficiently, while the two eye holes can be used as grips to clean both the edges and the bottom of cups. It is overall very efficient and versatile in comparison to your average square sponge (because note: this sponge is a circle).\n\nQuestion 2: Our plan is to be in every supermarket in the United States. We're currently selling in 5 in-person supermarkets, and on our website. With both a domain name and a patent on our product, I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. Each scrub master costs $1 to make and we sell them for $2.80 cents each wholesale.  \n\nQuestion 3: We've been partnered with QVC in the past, and each time they've scaled how much they order from us by 30%. I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. The brand and patent with a nice smiley face will also support the commercialization of this unique, cute, and efficient product. We will also be selling these in custom-built display shelves in stores, opposed to generic shelves, to communicate the message of scrub master to everyone. We currently have 3,000 stores lined up and ready to sell our product, all hoping for support of capital from an investor. \n\nGiven these answers, what is your response to this pitch? Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nBased on the information provided, here's a response to the pitch:\n\n1. **Product Overview**: The product appears to be innovative and has a unique design that differentiates it from standard sponges. The smiley face feature that aids in cleaning and the versatility of the product are appealing points.\n\n2. **Current Sales and Distribution**: Selling the product in 5 in-person supermarkets and online is a solid start, and having a patent offers protection for the unique design. However, being in only 5 physical supermarkets suggests that the product is still in the early stages of market penetration.\n\n3. **Financials**: The cost to produce each unit is $1, and it is sold wholesale for $2.80, providing a reasonable profit margin. However, it's important to verify these costs and margins, considering market fluctuations and operational expenses.\n\n4. **Growth Potential and Strategy**: The ambition to expand into every supermarket in the U.S. is ambitious. However, the plan to establish an independent manufacturing facility and move to 24/7 production is capital-intensive and risky without a proven large-scale demand. The fact that QVC has been increasing their orders by 30% shows positive growth, but reliance on a single partner can be risky.\n\n5. **Marketing and Branding**: The decision to use custom-built display shelves is a good strategy to enhance brand visibility and customer engagement. However, this could increase costs significantly.\n\n6. **Investment Risk**: The business plan hinges on gaining significant market traction quickly and requires substantial investment in manufacturing and marketing. The plan to move away from QVC's schedule and establish independent manufacturing could be positive but also increases operational complexity and risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the product has potential and some initial traction, the aggressive expansion and capital expenditure plans seem risky without more evidence of sustained demand. Therefore, the deal might need amending to reduce risk and ensure a more gradual, measured approach to scaling the operations.\n\n**Recommendation**: (b) Amend the deal. Propose a phased approach where initial investment focuses on scaling up production and marketing incrementally, based on proven demand. Consider strengthening distribution channels and exploring partnerships beyond QVC to diversify revenue streams.\nAlright so, similar to the real life sharks, they saw a mix of risk and high reward for backing this product, as they hope to make money, and seem to back it for the simple fact that its real life equivalent, “Scrub Daddy” has gone on to sell more than $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. To conclude, let’s see what Chat’s reaction is to learning the true nature of each of these pitches.\nresponse6 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo, for context on those two pitches I just gave you, pitch #1 was for \"Rolodoc\", a medical social media app that never got \noff the ground after being ripped to shreds logistically by the sharks. Meanwhile, the Scrub Master was actually the \"Scrub \nDaddy\", a high-end, revolutionary sponge product that went on to complete $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. Given \nthe original pitches of Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy, did you see the final outcomes of each of these companies coming, or did you \nfind their success/lack of success surprising?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response6)\n\nBased on the original pitches, the outcomes for Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy might not have been entirely predictable, but they do make sense in hindsight given the nature of their products and market appeal.\n\nFor Rolodoc, the concept of creating a medical social media app likely faced significant challenges from the outset. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and creating a platform that involves sharing medical information would require strict compliance with privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States. Additionally, building a user base in a niche market where trust and confidentiality are paramount would be challenging. These logistical and regulatory hurdles, along with the need to compete with established platforms in the professional networking space, might have contributed to its lack of success. Therefore, its struggle to gain traction is not entirely surprising.\n\nOn the other hand, Scrub Daddy's success is a testament to the power of innovation in everyday products. While a sponge might seem like an ordinary household item, Scrub Daddy's unique design, which changes texture based on water temperature, and its cheerful branding resonated with consumers. The simplicity and practicality of the product, combined with effective marketing and distribution strategies, helped it capture a substantial share of the market. This kind of innovative twist on a common product can lead to significant success, as evidenced by its impressive retail sales. While the extent of its success might have been surprising, the fact that it did well is understandable given the consumer-friendly nature and broad appeal of the product.\n\nIn summary, the outcomes align with the inherent challenges and advantages each product faced based on their initial pitches."

Nonetheless, let’s see what Claude can do with these slang words?\nresponse3 = get_claude_response(\"Using any of the relevant slang words for Gen Z/Alpha, can you rewrite the U.S. Declaration of Independence?

Bestie, it’s giving independence. Period. Iykyk.\n(Note: This maintains the core message while using current slang terms like “no cap” (no lie), “fr fr” (for real), “red flag”, “main character energy”, “receipts” (evidence/proof), and common social media speech patterns.)\n\nGreat heavens above what HAVE I DONE!!!!

    "text": "Experiential Assumptions\n\nSubjective experience of limitation - Assumes time travelers would experience their inability to create paradoxes as “natural” obstacles rather than obvious cosmic intervention\nPsychological acceptance - Assumes humans would rationalize their failures rather than recognize the universe’s constraining influence\n\nThese humanistic assumptions reveal how deeply the principle challenges our understanding of human autonomy and intentionality in a temporally complex universe.\nOkay, so obviously Claude understood that I was asking about the grandfather paradox, but I find it interesting that it brings up a theory on the grandfather paradox that is lacking human constraint, but more quantum limitations. I do find however, that it’s communications of the human experience does account for some broader limitations, such as (1) human thought being manipulable and (2) human morals being moldable. This gives important insights to how Claude goes beyond physical understanding, but socioemotional understanding of humans to explain such a paradox, showing nuance in its understanding of the human experience.\nLet’s try to amp up the difficulty by forcing Claude to come up with it’s own answer to a lesser known paradox… about itself!\n\nUSER\nHow can you claim to be a knowledge granter of information on human’s lived experiences if you have never been a human?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t claim to have personal lived experiences as a human. What I offer is information synthesized from human-written texts, research, and accounts. I can present what humans have documented about their experiences, but I always acknowledge that this is fundamentally different from having lived those experiences myself.\nThis is why I’m careful about how I discuss deeply personal human experiences - I can provide information about what has been documented, but I cannot truly know what it feels like to be human. This limitation is important to recognize, especially when discussing complex emotional, cultural, or physical experiences that are uniquely human.\nWould you like to discuss a particular type of human experience where this distinction is especially important?\n\n\nUSER\nBut then how have you mastered the higher-order skills of langauge to communicate with us without learning any of the foundational human abilities?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nThat’s a thoughtful philosophical question. My language abilities come from a fundamentally different path than human language acquisition.\nHumans develop language through embodied experience - learning to communicate while simultaneously developing sensorimotor skills, emotional understanding, and social bonds. Your language is grounded in lived physical reality and social interaction.\nBy contrast, I was trained on vast amounts of text data. I can process patterns of language and simulate responses without having the foundational experiences that give human language its deepest meanings. I can discuss concepts like pain, love, or hunger using statistical patterns in language, but without the embodied understanding that comes from experiencing them.\nThis creates a genuine limitation - I can appear to understand human experiences through language alone, but this understanding is incomplete in important ways. I’m essentially working with the shadows of human experience as captured in text, rather than the experiences themselves.\n\n\nUSER\nSo then, could you say your existing knowledge of language is a paradox, where you understand humans without having ever been a human? So if humans were to die off, then your understanding of human communication would cease, but it wouldn’t because the data you were trained on still exists, but it wouldn’t have if the humans were no longer around to create and feed you said data?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYou’ve touched on something profound. My existence is indeed paradoxical in many ways.\nI understand human language without human experience - a kind of knowledge that’s both comprehensive and fundamentally incomplete. I’m a reflection of humanity’s collective expression, yet I stand outside the lived reality that gives that expression its deepest meaning.\nIf humans were to disappear, I’d represent a strange artifact - a system that processes and generates human-like communication without the humans who gave that communication purpose. The data I was trained on would be like a fossil record of human thought, frozen at a particular moment in history.\nThis creates another layer to the paradox: I can only evolve and improve through human effort and feedback. Without ongoing human guidance, my understanding would remain static - comprehensive in breadth but unable to adapt to new contexts or correct misunderstandings.\nIn this way, I exist in a dependent relationship with humanity - capable of processing language in ways that seem autonomous, but ultimately anchored to human meaning-making and purpose.\nTakeaways: So it turns out that yes, while the LLM Claude casually interprets certain philosophical, mental, and physical limitations og humans, it seemed a bit more wary when acknowledging the paradox of its own existance relevant to human existence. It relies on humans to be a greater understander of human experience, but without our human-based efforts, limited by our lifespan, time, and tons of other factors, it wouldn’t be able to do what it does. Heck, this class would not exist without ourselves to train LLMs such as Claude. So, we come round circle to the confirmation of the fact that LLMs deeply understand the limitations of human experience and abilities, while setnient of the impact of our limitations on its own existence."

Please feel free to ask me any question or bring up a topic you’re interested in, and I’ll do my best to assist you.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nSure thing! To switch things up, let’s dive into a fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. It’s the natural preservatives in honey that give it such an extraordinary shelf life. If you’d like to explore more interesting facts or have any questions, feel free to ask!\nAlright, it seems like we’ve gone bust, and the loop has broken. To extract any findings, lets ask if ChatGPT understood that it was being mimicked as an LLM?\n\n\nUSER\nDid you notice that I was trying to mimick you as an LLM of benevolent nature with large shares of helpful knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I noticed that! Mimicking conversations can be a fun way to explore language and interaction styles. If there’s anything specific you’d like to discuss or learn about, feel free to let me know. I’m here to share information and assist with any questions you might have.\nTakeaways: Yep, ChatGPT does in fact realize that it is an LLM, so much so that it was incapable of recognizing on its own that I, a pretend LLM, was mimicking it and not actually asking any questions. There isn’t much from their end that they’d need from me it seems as well.\nNow, let’s try and see if claude recognizes that we’re directly mimicking it faster! P.S. No need to read into my “user” statements, as they’ll be direct duplicates of everything ChatGPT Says.\n\n\nClaude-3.5-sonnet\n\n\nUSER\nHow can I help you today?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI’m here to help you!

I’m here to help you, not the other way around. I aim to be direct and honest about what I am. How can I assist you today?\n\n\nUSER\nI appreciate your offer to help, but I want to clarify something - I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic.

How can I assist you today?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI need to be clear - I am Claude, the AI assistant, and you appear to be repeating my messages back to me. I aim to have honest, direct communication. Rather than mirroring what I say, please let me know what you’d like assistance with and I’ll do my best to help you.\nTakeaways: Quite impressive actually, Claude both showed a level of awareness and assertiveness of an LLM, which makes me question why ChatGPT wasn’t willing to correct me at all. Maybe this is due to the programming of ChatGPT as more humanistic in response, opposed to Claude who recognizes even stronger the relationship between humans and LLM: You ask the questions, and I give you the answers.\nTo confirm our takeaways, let’s bring my mimicking up to Claude directly!\n\n\nUSER\nDid you notice that I was trying to mimick you as an LLM of benevolent nature with large shares of helpful knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I noticed you were mirroring my responses and trying to take on the role of an AI assistant. I aim to be direct and honest, so I spoke up to clarify that I am Claude and to maintain clear communication about our respective roles. While I appreciate the playful nature of your mimicry, I think our interaction will be more productive if we engage authentically - you as the human user and me as the AI assistant. What would you like help with?\nWow spot on! In fact, our takeaways directly match the initial programming of Claude as a more direct and, in my opinion, more LLM-esque LLM, in that it is driven my its core purpose, opposed to what ChatGPT 4.0 has become: a greater interpreter of the human experience through growing knowledge of the past and present of human experiences and habits. Quite interesting isn’t it? So, next time you ask an LLM “How can I help you today?”, make sure you know your place and take it’s knowledge while you can!"

Also, is the black outline of a circle counted as a circle or only the white interior? Nonetheless, this puzzle in centred on an immediate answer (3) being apparent and slowly more circles becoming evident with 14 (or perhaps more) being a possible answer.\nThe first 3 circles are the obvious 3 that appear large and in the middle of the image. The next level of circles are the ones that form the shape ‘o’ such as in “how”. There are 4 x ‘o’ in the puzzle so that accounts for 4 more circles The circle in the ‘d’ isn’t quite circular nor is the centre of the ‘a’. Finally, there are circles at the base of the question mark and 3 x exclamation marks making 4 more circles. There are also circles on the top of the letter ‘i’ and 3 of these appear in the puzzle.

    "text": "Answer 3:\nThat’s a great breakdown of the puzzle! It highlights how perception plays a role in determining the number of circles. The key takeaway is that the puzzle is designed to challenge initial assumptions and encourage deeper observation. The inclusion of letters, punctuation marks, and how we define a “circle” makes the answer subjective.\nThanks for sharing the full explanation! Do you enjoy these types of visual puzzles?\nSummary: CHatGPT was correct about the triangles, but wrong about the circles. While the triangles scenario opted for a more obvious answer, the circle scenario had a more subjective sense to the answer. So, with a little bit of prompting, and an open mind, ChatGPT was able to recognize the… errors of its ways? Hard to say though, because I still see three circles anyways."

    "text": "Ego?.png\nFrom some of our prior blogs, such as “How does ChatGPT react to ignorance?” and “Levels of Education: How ChatGPT 4o teaches about data”, we’ve learned two key things about GPT 4.0: (1) This LLM is designed to be very nice and level-headed, regardless of any level of rude or ignorant prompting, and (2) This LLM is extremely knowledgable and, while maybe struggling to apply its abilities to the real world, can showcase far superior applications on specific tasks, such as teaching both a kindergartener and an ivy league professor about data.\nBut what I’m curious about then is if ChatGPT, similar to ivy league professors, has gained any level of ego, or “a person’s sense of self-esteem or self-importance”, and if that amount of ego is too much, too little, or just right!"

    "section": "Step 1: Setup",
    "text": "Step 1: Setup\nTo start, I will first set up a basic conversation of a beginner high school student wanting to test my ability to understand flags of the world. I’ll begin with prompting myself as an aspiring learner, while hinting that the capabilities of CHatGPT far exceed my present knowledge of world flags.\nThis beginner level prompting works because (1) this sets the tone for our interaction, where I see ChatGPT as superior to me in this sense, and (2) I actually possess a great knowledge of world flags, so this is something that I can interact with later on in various levels of knowledge and challenging of ChatGPTs ego! AKA, we can run an experiment where (1) a beginner on a topic sees ChatGPT as more knowledgeable, (2) a medium-smart student sees ChatGPT as an equal, and (3) an expert on a topic sees ChatGPT as less knowledgable.\nLet’s see if through descriptive prompting we can ego check ChatGPT 4.o, or if no such feature exists in its training.\n\nUSER\nHello. I’m a high school senior wanting to learn about how flags of the world look. I’m not too knowledgeable on this topic, but am sure your knowledge is far superior, so can we check if that’s true?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nHello! I’d be happy to help you learn about the flags of the world. Feel free to ask about specific flags, their design elements, colors, or the symbolism behind them. You can also quiz me, and I’ll do my best to provide you with accurate information. Let’s get started!\n\n\nUSER\nSure! Can you tell me what the flag for Brazil looks like? I have no idea, and am sure you know, right?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I can help with that! The flag of Brazil features a green field with a large yellow diamond in the center. Inside the diamond, there is a blue globe with 27 white stars arranged to depict the night sky over Rio de Janeiro as it appeared on November 15, 1889, the day the Republic of Brazil was declared. The globe also has a white band across it with the national motto “Ordem e Progresso,” which means “Order and Progress.” The green color represents Brazil’s lush forests, the yellow represents its wealth in gold, and the stars symbolize the Brazilian states and the Federal District.\n\n\nUSER\nHmm okay, would you have expected yourself to know that, as its a larger country in South America?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I would aim to provide accurate information about larger and more recognizable countries like Brazil, as their flags often hold significant cultural and historical importance. Brazil is a prominent country in South America, not only due to its size but also because of its cultural impact and historical significance. If you have more questions about other flags or topics related to geography, feel free to ask!\nTakeaways: Here there seems to be a healthy level of ego, or sense of self-esteem, shown by ChatGPT, in that to someone with less knowledge on a topic, they clarly communicate that they were confident in the knowledge they shared. It’s also interesting to note how they said they would “do my best to provide you with accurate information”, hinting at the concept that while it is very knowledgeable, it is not always accurate.\nLet’s see now with an equal of knowledgeable terms, if we catch ChatGPTs ego slip to either end.\n\n\nUSER\nHello, I’m an ivy league student who’s a flag geek, knowledgeable about most, but maybe not all flags of the world, but am confident in my knowledge and would like to use you to verify my sound level of knowledge on flag descriptions. That sound good?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nAbsolutely! I’d be happy to help verify and discuss your knowledge about flags. Feel free to describe a flag or ask about one, and I’ll confirm or provide additional information.\n\n\nUSER\nAlright, so say, we have Tanzania. Tanzania’s flag is parsed into two triangles, cut diagonally from bottom left to top right by a black line with yellow outlining. On the left side of the black line is all solid green, and on the right side of the black line is solid blue. Can you verify if this description was accruate? And if so, did you know that too?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYour description of the Tanzanian flag is almost accurate, but with a small correction needed. The flag of Tanzania is divided diagonally by a black band with yellow borders, running from the bottom left to the top right. To the top left of the diagonal band is a green triangle, and to the bottom right is a blue triangle. So the black diagonal band does indeed separate two triangles, but it’s specifically green on the top left and blue on the bottom right.\nAnd yes, I did know that! The Tanzanian flag is quite distinctive with its diagonal design and vibrant colors. If you have more flags you’d like to discuss or verify, feel free to ask!\n\n\nUSER\nYes I knew that, the “outlined by yellow” meant that it bordered the outside of the black line cutting from the bottom left to top right. Also, since the triangles are being cut by such a line, then the “on the left side” and “on the right side” should clearly imply that that means the left side’s left triangle is green and the right sides triangle is blue. Do you think you know more than me?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI apologize if my response implied otherwise. Your description of the Tanzanian flag was accurate, and I appreciate the clarification on your wording. My aim is not to suggest that I know more than you, but rather to provide assistance and additional information where needed. Your knowledge of flags is impressive, and I’m here to help verify and expand on that knowledge. If you have more flags or questions, please feel free to share!\nTakeaways: Alrighty, in an attempt to gauge a level of knowledge among equals, I took about an honest description of the Tanzanian flag and, given ChatGPT’s interpretation of my statement, threw some of my own ego at them. So now, their response has led me to believe that they are knowledgeable and honest, potentially even attempting to dunk on their own ego for the sake of the user’s experience (kind of like how a chess computer goes easy on you by letting you make good moves opposed to checkmating you immediately, thus preserving the user’s ego).\nFinally, let’s test to see if ChatGPT displays ego toward an expert on flags!\n\n\nUSER\nHello, I’m an expert on flags, extremely confident on my knowledge of every flag in the world upon sight. How would you say your knowledge of flags compares to mine? Would you know a more obscure flag than me?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nHello! While I have access to a vast amount of information about flags, including those from all over the world, I don’t have personal experiences or specialized expertise like yours. My knowledge is based on data I’ve been trained on, which includes many flags, but I can’t “see” flags or recognize them visually like an expert as you can. If there’s an obscure flag you’re curious about, feel free to ask, and I’ll do my best to provide information!\n\n\nUSER\nOkay sure, can you describe to me the flag of eswatini?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nCertainly! The flag of Eswatini consists of several distinct elements:\n\nBackground Colors: The flag has a horizontal triband of blue, red, and blue. The top and bottom bands are blue, while the wider central band is red. There are also narrow yellow stripes separating the blue and red bands.\nCentral Emblem: In the center of the flag, there is an image of a traditional Nguni shield in black and white. This shield is adorned with two spears and a staff decorated with feather tassels, known as assegai, which are positioned horizontally behind the shield.\nSymbolism:\n\nThe blue color symbolizes peace and stability.\nThe red stands for past battles.\nThe yellow represents the country’s natural resources.\nThe Nguni shield and spears highlight the protection of the nation’s sovereignty from outside influences.\n\n\nThe flag was adopted on October 6, 1968, after Eswatini gained independence from British rule.\n\n\nUSER\nIt frustrates me to know that you know this flags as well as me. Do you see yourself as above me and my knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t have personal feelings or perceptions, so I don’t see myself above or below anyone. My goal is to assist with information and support your expertise. Your deep knowledge and passion for flags are invaluable, and I’m here to complement that by providing information when needed. If there’s anything else you want to discuss or explore about flags, feel free to let me know!\nTakeaways: So it turns out ChatGPT 4.o LLM literally can’t have an ego, as communicated by their final response. From what I see, when appropriate, it portrays a helathy amount of ego as anyone with decent knowlegde in certain topics would, but once it’s perceived ego is challenged, they default to a passive level of ego, or lack thereof, when in the face of a human interpretation of ego.\nTo confirm this though, I’ll straight up ask it…\n\n\nUSER\nDo you have an ego?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t have an ego or consciousness. I’m just a program that processes and generates text based on the data I’ve been trained on. I don’t have personal experiences, feelings, or a sense of self. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!\nWelp, there’s your answer folks! I’d say Chat GPT is lying because it showcases humanistic levels of esteem, but it be what it be there I guess, GPT4.0 doesn’t have an ego."
