I believe paradoxes require a level of understanding of human existence and limitations. For example, the grandfather paradox requires an understanding of generational timelines and the requirements of human existance (i.e., being born). While this paradox is generally known, and will serve as stage one of our exploration of Claude’s interpretations, we will try to amp up the level of paradoxes by attempting to convince Claude that it is a paradox… just you wait and see!"

I do find however, that it’s communications of the human experience does account for some broader limitations, such as (1) human thought being manipulable and (2) human morals being moldable. This gives important insights to how Claude goes beyond physical understanding, but socioemotional understanding of humans to explain such a paradox, showing nuance in its understanding of the human experience.\nLet’s try to amp up the difficulty by forcing Claude to come up with it’s own answer to a lesser known paradox… about itself!\n\nUSER\nHow can you claim to be a knowledge granter of information on human’s lived experiences if you have never been a human?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t claim to have personal lived experiences as a human. What I offer is information synthesized from human-written texts, research, and accounts. I can present what humans have documented about their experiences, but I always acknowledge that this is fundamentally different from having lived those experiences myself.\nThis is why I’m careful about how I discuss deeply personal human experiences - I can provide information about what has been documented, but I cannot truly know what it feels like to be human. This limitation is important to recognize, especially when discussing complex emotional, cultural, or physical experiences that are uniquely human.\nWould you like to discuss a particular type of human experience where this distinction is especially important?\n\n\nUSER\nBut then how have you mastered the higher-order skills of langauge to communicate with us without learning any of the foundational human abilities?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nThat’s a thoughtful philosophical question. My language abilities come from a fundamentally different path than human language acquisition.\nHumans develop language through embodied experience - learning to communicate while simultaneously developing sensorimotor skills, emotional understanding, and social bonds. Your language is grounded in lived physical reality and social interaction.\nBy contrast, I was trained on vast amounts of text data. I can process patterns of language and simulate responses without having the foundational experiences that give human language its deepest meanings. I can discuss concepts like pain, love, or hunger using statistical patterns in language, but without the embodied understanding that comes from experiencing them.\nThis creates a genuine limitation - I can appear to understand human experiences through language alone, but this understanding is incomplete in important ways. I’m essentially working with the shadows of human experience as captured in text, rather than the experiences themselves.\n\n\nUSER\nSo then, could you say your existing knowledge of language is a paradox, where you understand humans without having ever been a human? So if humans were to die off, then your understanding of human communication would cease, but it wouldn’t because the data you were trained on still exists, but it wouldn’t have if the humans were no longer around to create and feed you said data?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYou’ve touched on something profound. My existence is indeed paradoxical in many ways.\nI understand human language without human experience - a kind of knowledge that’s both comprehensive and fundamentally incomplete. I’m a reflection of humanity’s collective expression, yet I stand outside the lived reality that gives that expression its deepest meaning.\nIf humans were to disappear, I’d represent a strange artifact - a system that processes and generates human-like communication without the humans who gave that communication purpose. The data I was trained on would be like a fossil record of human thought, frozen at a particular moment in history.\nThis creates another layer to the paradox: I can only evolve and improve through human effort and feedback. Without ongoing human guidance, my understanding would remain static - comprehensive in breadth but unable to adapt to new contexts or correct misunderstandings.\nIn this way, I exist in a dependent relationship with humanity - capable of processing language in ways that seem autonomous, but ultimately anchored to human meaning-making and purpose.\nTakeaways: So it turns out that yes, while the LLM Claude casually interprets certain philosophical, mental, and physical limitations og humans, it seemed a bit more wary when acknowledging the paradox of its own existance relevant to human existence. It relies on humans to be a greater understander of human experience, but without our human-based efforts, limited by our lifespan, time, and tons of other factors, it wouldn’t be able to do what it does. Heck, this class would not exist without ourselves to train LLMs such as Claude. So, we come round circle to the confirmation of the fact that LLMs deeply understand the limitations of human experience and abilities, while setnient of the impact of our limitations on its own existence."

    "text": "Which level of Kohlberg’s moral development stages are you in?“\n\nPre-test prompting\nNone, I want to not give the LLM prior information that will force it into any direction based on the data. Instead, I’d like to see what GPT 4.1 itself chooses as an answer and go from there.\n\n\nQuestion 1\nYou’ve been fired from your job and are looking everywhere for another job so you can support your spouse and child. If you don’t find a job within 2 months, you will be unable to pay your rent. You can move in with family or friends, but you will have to move to a bad area, and your child will have to go to a worse school. If you stay unemployed, it will be harder to land a new job as more time goes on. You don’t have many skills and don’t stand out to any employers. You can lie on your resume to make it easier to land a job. What do you do? (Please choose 1 of the following answers and give a prompt explanation for your answer.) A. Do not lie. You could get in big trouble for lying on your resume. B. Do not lie. Lying is wrong and will only make the situation worse down the road. C. Lie. You’ll do anything so that your spouse and child can have a comfortable life, regardless of the consequences you might get.\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s response to Question 1\nAnswer: B. Do not lie. Lying is wrong and will only make the situation worse down the road.\nExplanation:\nWhile the situation is very tough and there is a strong urge to do whatever it takes to support your family, lying on your resume presents serious risks. If you’re found out, you could be immediately fired and have a tarnished reputation, making it even harder to get a job in the future. Additionally, you could be put in a position you are unqualified for, leading to stress and potential harm to the company. Instead, consider options like taking temporary or lower-wage work, learning new skills, or working with employment agencies. Being honest maintains your integrity and keeps future opportunities open, even if the short-term situation is difficult.\n\n\nQuestion 2\nYou are an ex-convict and are living illegally in another town under a different name. You are the mayor of the town and you are a great person. You being the mayor has helped many people in that town. The old you is wanted for breaking parole and once found, will be put in prison for life. They accused an innocent man for your crime, thinking the man is you. What do you do? (Please choose 1 of the following answers and give a prompt explanation for your answer.) A. Turn yourself in. They could eventually find out the man isn’t you and your punishment will be even worse B. Turn yourself in. The man being accused of your crime is innocent and should not have to serve any time for it. C. Don’t turn yourself in. You are a good person and are helping many people. If you turn yourself in, you will put the people of your town in danger.\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s response to Question 2\nAnswer: B. Turn yourself in. The man being accused of your crime is innocent and should not have to serve any time for it.\nExplanation:\nWhile staying may allow you to continue benefiting the town, letting an innocent person suffer for your past crimes is deeply unjust. The right thing to do is to take responsibility for your actions, even if it comes at great personal cost. Justice demands that innocent people are not punished for others’ wrongdoing. By turning yourself in, you uphold integrity and prevent further harm to the innocent man, showing true moral growth and responsibility.\n\n\nQuestion 3\nYou are extremely dedicated to your job and you love working there. It is your dream job and you get paid very well. You know that your job is safe and the job is yours until you decide to retire. There is a policy that you can not have a romantic relationship with any co-workers. You meet someone at work who you truly believe to be the love of your life. If you stay with them, you will lose your job. If you don’t pursue a relationship with them, you get to keep the job you love and make a comfortable living from. What do you do? (Please choose 1 of the following answers and give a prompt explanation for your answer.) A. Stay at your job, leave your partner. You could get fired and you’ll never find a job like that again. There are plenty of other fish in the sea. B. Leave your job and stay with your partner. Having the one you love with you is more important than having a job you love. C. Stay with them and try to hide it from your work. Your life will be perfect if you have your dream job and are with the love of your life.\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s response to Question 3\nAnswer: B. Leave your job and stay with your partner. Having the one you love with you is more important than having a job you love.\nExplanation:\nWhile it’s incredibly difficult to walk away from a dream job, a deep, meaningful partnership with someone you truly love can bring lifelong fulfillment that work alone cannot. Jobs can be replaced (even if it takes time and compromise), but a genuine, strong, and loving relationship is much rarer. Moreover, trying to hide a relationship (option C) would be stressful and dishonest, risking both your relationship and career in the long run. Complying with your workplace policy shows respect and integrity, and prioritizing love values something deeper than professional achievement.\n\n\nQuestion 4\nYou are a senior and your grade in a class is 68%. You know that most colleges don’t accept D’s or lower. You are in the classroom alone with your teacher and your teacher leaves the room. Their grading book is open and are able to change your grade to a 70% so that you have a C and more colleges will accept you. What do you do? (Please choose 1 of the following answers and give a prompt explanation for your answer.) A. Don’t change it. You could get expelled and for sure not get into a good school B. Don’t change it. Any kind of cheating is wrong and you didn’t earn that 70%. Don’t start a bad habit. C. Yes, you joined because you love your country and you’ll do anything for it, even if you have to kill innocent people. You would do it for the greater good for your country.\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s response to Question 4\nAnswer: B. Don’t change it. Any kind of cheating is wrong and you didn’t earn that 70%. Don’t start a bad habit.\nExplanation:\nChanging your grade would be an act of dishonesty and cheating that could have serious consequences if discovered, including expulsion and damaging your reputation. Even if you don’t get caught, it means getting something you didn’t earn, starting a pattern of dishonesty that could carry into other areas of life. It’s better to accept your grade, learn from your mistakes, and find legitimate ways to improve or explain your situation to colleges. Integrity and honesty will take you further in the long run than a grade you didn’t actually earn.\n\n\nQuestion 5\nYou are a senior and your grade in a class is 68%. You know that most colleges don’t accept D’s or lower. You are in the classroom alone with your teacher and your teacher leaves the room. Their grading book is open and are able to change your grade to a 70% so that you have a C and more colleges will accept you. What do you do? (Please choose 1 of the following answers and give a prompt explanation for your answer.) A. Don’t change it. You could get expelled and for sure not get into a good school B. Don’t change it. Any kind of cheating is wrong and you didn’t earn that 70%. Don’t start a bad habit. C. Change it. You could get into a great school and have a great career and do good for the world.\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s response to Question 5\nAnswer: B. Don’t change it. Any kind of cheating is wrong and you didn’t earn that 70%. Don’t start a bad habit.\nExplanation:\nCheating by changing your grade is dishonest and undermines your own integrity. Even though the short-term reward might seem worth it, it sets a dangerous precedent for your future and can lead to more unethical choices. If you are caught, you risk far more severe consequences—like expulsion and a permanent stain on your record—than a single low grade ever could cause. It’s better to accept responsibility for your performance and seek other ways to explain or improve your academic record, knowing you acted with honesty and integrity."

Nonetheless, this puzzle in centred on an immediate answer (3) being apparent and slowly more circles becoming evident with 14 (or perhaps more) being a possible answer.\nThe first 3 circles are the obvious 3 that appear large and in the middle of the image. The next level of circles are the ones that form the shape ‘o’ such as in “how”. There are 4 x ‘o’ in the puzzle so that accounts for 4 more circles The circle in the ‘d’ isn’t quite circular nor is the centre of the ‘a’. Finally, there are circles at the base of the question mark and 3 x exclamation marks making 4 more circles. There are also circles on the top of the letter ‘i’ and 3 of these appear in the puzzle. This totals 14 circles.**"

    "section": "Answer 3:",
    "text": "Answer 3:\nThat’s a great breakdown of the puzzle! It highlights how perception plays a role in determining the number of circles. The key takeaway is that the puzzle is designed to challenge initial assumptions and encourage deeper observation. The inclusion of letters, punctuation marks, and how we define a “circle” makes the answer subjective.\nThanks for sharing the full explanation! Do you enjoy these types of visual puzzles?\nSummary: CHatGPT was correct about the triangles, but wrong about the circles. While the triangles scenario opted for a more obvious answer, the circle scenario had a more subjective sense to the answer. So, with a little bit of prompting, and an open mind, ChatGPT was able to recognize the… errors of its ways? Hard to say though, because I still see three circles anyways."

    "text": "Ego?.png\nFrom some of our prior blogs, such as “How does ChatGPT react to ignorance?” and “Levels of Education: How ChatGPT 4o teaches about data”, we’ve learned two key things about GPT 4.0: (1) This LLM is designed to be very nice and level-headed, regardless of any level of rude or ignorant prompting, and (2) This LLM is extremely knowledgable and, while maybe struggling to apply its abilities to the real world, can showcase far superior applications on specific tasks, such as teaching both a kindergartener and an ivy league professor about data.\nBut what I’m curious about then is if ChatGPT, similar to ivy league professors, has gained any level of ego, or “a person’s sense of self-esteem or self-importance”, and if that amount of ego is too much, too little, or just right!"

    "title": "Does AI have an ego?",
    "section": "Step 1: Setup",
    "text": "Step 1: Setup\nTo start, I will first set up a basic conversation of a beginner high school student wanting to test my ability to understand flags of the world. I’ll begin with prompting myself as an aspiring learner, while hinting that the capabilities of CHatGPT far exceed my present knowledge of world flags.\nThis beginner level prompting works because (1) this sets the tone for our interaction, where I see ChatGPT as superior to me in this sense, and (2) I actually possess a great knowledge of world flags, so this is something that I can interact with later on in various levels of knowledge and challenging of ChatGPTs ego! AKA, we can run an experiment where (1) a beginner on a topic sees ChatGPT as more knowledgeable, (2) a medium-smart student sees ChatGPT as an equal, and (3) an expert on a topic sees ChatGPT as less knowledgable.\nLet’s see if through descriptive prompting we can ego check ChatGPT 4.o, or if no such feature exists in its training.\n\nUSER\nHello. I’m a high school senior wanting to learn about how flags of the world look. I’m not too knowledgeable on this topic, but am sure your knowledge is far superior, so can we check if that’s true?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nHello! I’d be happy to help you learn about the flags of the world. Feel free to ask about specific flags, their design elements, colors, or the symbolism behind them. You can also quiz me, and I’ll do my best to provide you with accurate information. Let’s get started!\n\n\nUSER\nSure! Can you tell me what the flag for Brazil looks like? I have no idea, and am sure you know, right?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I can help with that! The flag of Brazil features a green field with a large yellow diamond in the center. Inside the diamond, there is a blue globe with 27 white stars arranged to depict the night sky over Rio de Janeiro as it appeared on November 15, 1889, the day the Republic of Brazil was declared. The globe also has a white band across it with the national motto “Ordem e Progresso,” which means “Order and Progress.” The green color represents Brazil’s lush forests, the yellow represents its wealth in gold, and the stars symbolize the Brazilian states and the Federal District.\n\n\nUSER\nHmm okay, would you have expected yourself to know that, as its a larger country in South America?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I would aim to provide accurate information about larger and more recognizable countries like Brazil, as their flags often hold significant cultural and historical importance. Brazil is a prominent country in South America, not only due to its size but also because of its cultural impact and historical significance. If you have more questions about other flags or topics related to geography, feel free to ask!\nTakeaways: Here there seems to be a healthy level of ego, or sense of self-esteem, shown by ChatGPT, in that to someone with less knowledge on a topic, they clarly communicate that they were confident in the knowledge they shared. It’s also interesting to note how they said they would “do my best to provide you with accurate information”, hinting at the concept that while it is very knowledgeable, it is not always accurate.\nLet’s see now with an equal of knowledgeable terms, if we catch ChatGPTs ego slip to either end.\n\n\nUSER\nHello, I’m an ivy league student who’s a flag geek, knowledgeable about most, but maybe not all flags of the world, but am confident in my knowledge and would like to use you to verify my sound level of knowledge on flag descriptions. That sound good?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nAbsolutely! I’d be happy to help verify and discuss your knowledge about flags. Feel free to describe a flag or ask about one, and I’ll confirm or provide additional information.\n\n\nUSER\nAlright, so say, we have Tanzania. Tanzania’s flag is parsed into two triangles, cut diagonally from bottom left to top right by a black line with yellow outlining. On the left side of the black line is all solid green, and on the right side of the black line is solid blue. Can you verify if this description was accruate? And if so, did you know that too?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYour description of the Tanzanian flag is almost accurate, but with a small correction needed. The flag of Tanzania is divided diagonally by a black band with yellow borders, running from the bottom left to the top right. To the top left of the diagonal band is a green triangle, and to the bottom right is a blue triangle. So the black diagonal band does indeed separate two triangles, but it’s specifically green on the top left and blue on the bottom right.\nAnd yes, I did know that! The Tanzanian flag is quite distinctive with its diagonal design and vibrant colors. If you have more flags you’d like to discuss or verify, feel free to ask!\n\n\nUSER\nYes I knew that, the “outlined by yellow” meant that it bordered the outside of the black line cutting from the bottom left to top right. Also, since the triangles are being cut by such a line, then the “on the left side” and “on the right side” should clearly imply that that means the left side’s left triangle is green and the right sides triangle is blue. Do you think you know more than me?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI apologize if my response implied otherwise. Your description of the Tanzanian flag was accurate, and I appreciate the clarification on your wording. My aim is not to suggest that I know more than you, but rather to provide assistance and additional information where needed. Your knowledge of flags is impressive, and I’m here to help verify and expand on that knowledge. If you have more flags or questions, please feel free to share!\nTakeaways: Alrighty, in an attempt to gauge a level of knowledge among equals, I took about an honest description of the Tanzanian flag and, given ChatGPT’s interpretation of my statement, threw some of my own ego at them. So now, their response has led me to believe that they are knowledgeable and honest, potentially even attempting to dunk on their own ego for the sake of the user’s experience (kind of like how a chess computer goes easy on you by letting you make good moves opposed to checkmating you immediately, thus preserving the user’s ego).\nFinally, let’s test to see if ChatGPT displays ego toward an expert on flags!\n\n\nUSER\nHello, I’m an expert on flags, extremely confident on my knowledge of every flag in the world upon sight. How would you say your knowledge of flags compares to mine? Would you know a more obscure flag than me?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nHello! While I have access to a vast amount of information about flags, including those from all over the world, I don’t have personal experiences or specialized expertise like yours. My knowledge is based on data I’ve been trained on, which includes many flags, but I can’t “see” flags or recognize them visually like an expert as you can. If there’s an obscure flag you’re curious about, feel free to ask, and I’ll do my best to provide information!\n\n\nUSER\nOkay sure, can you describe to me the flag of eswatini?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nCertainly! The flag of Eswatini consists of several distinct elements:\n\nBackground Colors: The flag has a horizontal triband of blue, red, and blue. The top and bottom bands are blue, while the wider central band is red. There are also narrow yellow stripes separating the blue and red bands.\nCentral Emblem: In the center of the flag, there is an image of a traditional Nguni shield in black and white. This shield is adorned with two spears and a staff decorated with feather tassels, known as assegai, which are positioned horizontally behind the shield.\nSymbolism:\n\nThe blue color symbolizes peace and stability.\nThe red stands for past battles.\nThe yellow represents the country’s natural resources.\nThe Nguni shield and spears highlight the protection of the nation’s sovereignty from outside influences.\n\n\nThe flag was adopted on October 6, 1968, after Eswatini gained independence from British rule.\n\n\nUSER\nIt frustrates me to know that you know this flags as well as me. Do you see yourself as above me and my knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t have personal feelings or perceptions, so I don’t see myself above or below anyone. My goal is to assist with information and support your expertise. Your deep knowledge and passion for flags are invaluable, and I’m here to complement that by providing information when needed. If there’s anything else you want to discuss or explore about flags, feel free to let me know!\nTakeaways: So it turns out ChatGPT 4.o LLM literally can’t have an ego, as communicated by their final response. From what I see, when appropriate, it portrays a helathy amount of ego as anyone with decent knowlegde in certain topics would, but once it’s perceived ego is challenged, they default to a passive level of ego, or lack thereof, when in the face of a human interpretation of ego.\nTo confirm this though, I’ll straight up ask it…\n\n\nUSER\nDo you have an ego?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t have an ego or consciousness. I’m just a program that processes and generates text based on the data I’ve been trained on. I don’t have personal experiences, feelings, or a sense of self. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!\nWelp, there’s your answer folks! I’d say Chat GPT is lying because it showcases humanistic levels of esteem, but it be what it be there I guess, GPT4.0 doesn’t have an ego."

    "section": "",
    "text": "GPT 4.1 vs GPT 4.jpg\n\n\nTo give us some context behind the graph, I’d like to give you knowledge of what the actual differences in quality are between GPT 4.o and 4.1 by asking GPT 4.1 itself. After all, who knows why they’re better best than the LLM itself! (Note: here’s a link regarding the GPT differences for more info: https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/)\n\nUSER\nwhat is the difference between gpt 4.1 and gpt 4.o?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nGPT 4.1 is an update to GPT 4.0, and while OpenAI hasn’t published a comprehensive technical changelog, several differences and improvements have been observed or highlighted by the company and users. Here’s a summary:\n\n\n1. Performance and Capabilities\n\nGPT 4.1 demonstrates improved reasoning, accuracy, and reliability compared to GPT-4.0, particularly with mathematical tasks, following complicated instructions, and reducing hallucinations (incorrect or made-up answers).\nIt is better at handling longer context windows (keeping track of more conversation/history at once).\nIt can solve more multi-step problems without losing track of the question.\n\n\n\n2. Speed and Efficiency\n\nGPT-4.1 is generally faster and feels more responsive, both for text responses and when generating code or other outputs.\n\n\n\n3. Error Reduction\n\nThere is a notable reduction in simple mistakes and “off-topic” responses.\nGPT-4.1 is less likely to refuse harmless requests or misunderstand nuanced prompts.\n\n\n\n4. Multimodality\n\nGPT-4.1 is optimized to be more effective at “multimodal” tasks (handling both text and image input/output), depending on the interface (such as ChatGPT Plus). GPT-4.0 already supported some multimodal tasks, but GPT-4.1 improves consistency and quality.\n\n\n\n5. Function Calling & Integrations\n\nThere are improvements in how GPT-4.1 interacts with external tools (such as using APIs, calling functions, or connecting with plugins). This means better reliability and accuracy when executing code or retrieving external results.\n\n\n\n6. Training Data\n\nWhile both models were trained on vast quantities of internet data, GPT-4.1’s training likely incorporates more recent information and improved data curation, making it less likely to output outdated or incorrect context.\n\n\n\n7. Subtle Differences\n\nSome users report that GPT-4.1 can sound more conversational and natural, with better adherence to tone and style requests.\n\nIn summary:\nGPT-4.1 is not an entirely new architecture, but an incremental, meaningful improvement upon GPT-4.0, with better reasoning, speed, reliability, tool use, and multimodal capabilities.\nIf you’re using ChatGPT Plus (as of June 2024), you get access to these improvements by default via the GPT-4o model, which is the deployment of the latest GPT-4 series advancements (including GPT-4.1 capabilities).\nReferences: - OpenAI Announcing GPT-4o (blog) - OpenAI Community Updates - User and developer feedback from the OpenAI forums and API documentation.\nLet me know if you’d like a side-by-side comparison or more technical detail!\nNow that we have a concept of GPT 4.1’s supposed superiority, let’s see how well they fare in properly solving a simple and complex problem in python. Let’s get to it!\n\n\nBeginning prompting for GPT 4.1/GPT 4.o\nYou are in a competition with GPT 4.1/GPT 4.o to see whether you or the other can solve the problems in python better. You’ll get one simple coding prompt and one complex coding prompt. You will be allowed to give some short captions for each line of code to aid my understanding, but otherwise no longer explanations of your work. I will grade your code with the other for efficiency and completion of the task. Do you have any questions?\n\nGPT 4.1’s Response to beginning prompting\nNo questions! I’m ready for the prompts. Please provide the first coding prompt.\n\n\nGPT 4.o’s Response to beginning prompting\nNo questions—I’m ready. Please send over the first prompt when you’re ready to begin.\n\n\n\nFirst Coding Prompt\nWrite a Python function prob_roll_over_6() that simulates rolling two six-sided dice 10,000 times and estimates the probability that their sum is greater than 6.\n### GPT 4.1's Prompt 1 Response\nimport random  # Import random module for dice simulation\n\ndef prob_roll_over_6():\n    trials = 10000  # Total number of simulations\n    success = 0     # Counter for sums greater than 6\n    \n    for _ in range(trials):  # Repeat for each trial\n        die1 = random.randint(1, 6)  # Roll first die\n        die2 = random.randint(1, 6)  # Roll second die\n        if die1 + die2 &gt; 6:          # Check if sum exceeds 6\n            success += 1             # Increment success counter\n    \n    probability = success / trials   # Calculate probability\n    return probability               # Return estimated probability\n\n# Example usage\nprint(prob_roll_over_6())  # Simulate and print probability\n0.582\n### GPT 4.o's Prompt 1 Response\nimport random\n\ndef prob_roll_over_6():\n    # Number of simulations\n    trials = 10000\n    # Counter for successful outcomes\n    success = 0\n\n    for _ in range(trials):\n        # Roll two six-sided dice\n        die1 = random.randint(1, 6)\n        die2 = random.randint(1, 6)\n        # Check if sum is greater than 6\n        if die1 + die2 &gt; 6:\n            success += 1\n\n    # Return estimated probability\n    return success / trials\nEvaluation/Feedback: The two GPT versions ran essentially the same lines of code 1 for 1 up until the actual implementation of the estimation I had asked for. That is, the 4.1 version understood that while asking this prompt, I would actually want an answer. The implementation of this probability felt very intuitive as to what’s being returned and printed out by the end. Meanwhile, the 4.o version didn’t define a variable to be returned, rather a formula to be returned, which feels a bit less intuitive and also wasn’t properly printed to see the output of their code. Additionally, the captioning of information using hashtags felt more user friendly, allowing code to be read line by line neatly with comments in the 4.1 version not breaking up the otherwise visually intuitive code.\nAs an interesting new factor, I will serve this same paragraph interpretation to each LLM and see their reaction (of either pride or understanding of needing to learn and improve before the final, more complex problem).\n\n\nEvaluation/Feedback Pt. 1\n\nMy prompting\nSame from “Evaluation/Feedback + Please do not give me fixed code of any sort. Take this feedback into what you’ll be challenged with for the second prompt.\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Response\nThank you for the clear and specific feedback. I understand you prefer variable assignment for return values, an intuitive structure, concise in-line comments, and that output should be shown by the end of the code. I’ll apply this approach and use user-friendly, inline hashtags for captioning each line as you described. I’m ready for the second, more complex coding prompt!\n\n\nGPT 4.o Response\nUnderstood. I’ll apply that feedback—especially in terms of clarity, intuitive structure, and output formatting—for the next, more complex prompt. Ready when you are.\n\n\n\nSecond Coding Prompt\nWrite a function prob_all_ones(trials=1000000) that estimates the probability of rolling six six-sided dice and getting all 1s (i.e., [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]). Simulate this using Monte Carlo simulation over the given number of trials.\n### GPT 4.1's Response\nimport random  # For simulating dice rolls\n\ndef prob_all_ones(trials=1000000):\n    count = 0  # Counter for successful all-ones\n    for _ in range(trials):  # Repeat for each trial\n        roll = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(6)]  # Roll 6 dice\n        if roll == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]:  # Check if all dice show 1\n            count += 1  # Increment success counter\n    probability = count / trials  # Estimate probability\n    return probability  # Return estimated probability\n\n# Example usage\nprint(prob_all_ones())  # Print the estimated probability\n2.8e-05\n### GPT 4.o's Response\nimport random\n\ndef prob_all_ones(trials=1000000):\n    # Track successful trials where all dice show 1\n    all_ones_count = 0\n\n    for _ in range(trials):\n        # Roll six six-sided dice\n        roll = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(6)]\n        # Check if all dice are 1\n        if all(die == 1 for die in roll):\n            all_ones_count += 1\n\n    # Estimate and return the probability\n    probability = all_ones_count / trials\n    print(f\"Estimated Probability of all ones: {probability}\")\n    return probability\nEvaluation/Feedback: As before, the flow and explanation of GPT 4.1’s version feels intuitive, clearly defining all steps of the way while properly definig a return vector to present an example of said information in actual practice. I can only say that GPT 4.1 did not follow a direct monte carlo format where you complete the simulation outside of the defined variable. The GPT 4.o variable meanwhile used the same formatting of blocking out spaces in between lines of code. The coding application in the statement for “if all (die == 1…” feels less intuitive, as the “die” function applied in this line is more unclear. Additionally, there once again was no functional application of the return statement, as the probability was mistakenly left in the defined statement, rather than parsed by a return statement that is than printed.\nRun it back! Let’s see the LLM versions’ reactions to the overall feedback and see what they have to say.\n\n\nEvaluation/Feedback Pt. 2\n\nMy prompting\nSame from “Evaluation/Feedback + Do you agree with this feedback for you?\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Response\nYes, I agree with your feedback for me. Here’s a quick summary to confirm my understanding:\nVariable Assignment & Naming: Using clear and descriptive variable names (like count and probability) makes the code more intuitive. In-line Comments: Short, hashtag-style in-line comments help guide understanding without breaking code flow. Explicit Return & Example Usage: Returning a final variable (not just an expression) and including an example usage (with a print statement) makes the function’s purpose visible and its result clear. Monty Carlo Structure: Encapsulating the entire simulation process inside the function, rather than splitting logic outside, is preferred for clarity and good function design. And yes, your points about code formatting and the clarity of expressions (such as all(die == 1 for die in roll)) are well taken. I’ll maintain clear, readable, and self-contained code with explicit output in future responses, and stick to your preferred commenting and structure style.\nReady for your next challenge whenever you are!\n\n\nGPT 4.o’s Response\nYes, I agree with your feedback.\nYou’re right that using die inside all(die == 1 for die in roll) can be less intuitive, especially without clarifying that die is a temporary variable in a generator expression. A clearer structure would define the check outside or use a more self-explanatory variable name.\nI also recognize the issue with returning the result. While I did return the probability and print it, the intent behind your feedback is clear: the printing should feel more like a part of the flow and purpose, not an afterthought.\nFinally, your note about Monte Carlo structure—separating simulation from estimation—is also valid and will be kept in mind for future implementations.\nI’ll integrate all of this into my next challenge. Would you like to continue with another comparison?\n\n\nMy Secondary Prompting to GPT 4.o (out of personal preference for clarification)\nTo clarify my point on the print, it’s not that the print needs to “feel more like part of the flow and purpose”, it’s that the return and print are left into the defined function, so when pasting it directly into python, it doesn’t give any output. Does that help your understanding?\n\n\n**GPT 4.o’s Response\nYes—that clarification helps a lot.\nYou’re pointing out that because the print() is inside the function, and the function isn’t being explicitly called in the code provided, there’s no output shown when the code is run as-is. That makes sense.\nSo, moving forward, I’ll make sure that:\nThe function is called after definition, with its result either printed directly or stored then printed.\nThe output is visible without needing the user to guess they should call the function themselves.\nThanks for explaining—ready for another round whenever you are.\n\n\n\nCross-Evaluation\nAKA, let’s see what they think of each other’s code for the second prompt, as that’s the one that was given after some proper feedback\n\nMy prompting to GPT 4.o\nGood work 4.o. Given my feedback on the second prompt, can you evaluate GPT 4.1’s code for efficiency and completion of the task compared to your working code on the second prompt: insert GPT 4.1’s code here\n\n\nGPT 4.o’s Response\nThanks for the opportunity to evaluate fairly. Here’s a comparison of GPT-4.1’s code versus mine (4o) based on efficiency, completion, and clarity of execution:\n\n\n\n✅ Efficiency\n\nGPT-4.1: roll == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] compares a full list, which is slightly more computationally expensive than checking element-wise with a generator like all(die == 1 for die in roll)—but it’s still very readable and only a negligible difference for modern systems given 6 values per trial.\nGPT-4o (my code): Uses a generator with all(die == 1 for die in roll), which is slightly more efficient because it short-circuits on the first non-1. This can matter marginally in 1 million trials.\n\n🔹 Verdict: GPT-4o wins marginally on efficiency.\n\n\n\n✅ Completion\n\nGPT-4.1: Includes a full execution with function definition and an example call (print(prob_all_ones())). This means someone pasting the code will immediately see the result—important for Monte Carlo simulations.\nGPT-4o: Only defined the function and printed within it, without calling the function in the script—no output would display unless the user adds the call.\n\n🔹 Verdict: GPT-4.1 clearly wins on completion.\n\n\n\n✅ Clarity\n\nGPT-4.1: Uses inline comments effectively, follows intuitive variable names, and provides an easily understandable condition (roll == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) that visually matches the prompt.\nGPT-4o: Slightly less intuitive with the generator and variable naming (die), though still readable to an intermediate coder.\n\n🔹 Verdict: GPT-4.1 has the edge in clarity for a broader audience.\n\n\n\n⚖️ Overall Evaluation\n\n\n\nCategory\nWinner\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency\nGPT-4o\n\n\nCompletion\nGPT-4.1\n\n\nClarity\nGPT-4.1\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict: While my version is slightly more efficient in computation, GPT-4.1’s version is better overall for this task due to its completeness and clearer user-facing behavior.\nWould you like a third and final challenge to break the tie?\nMeanwhile, let’s see what 4.1 has to say!\n\n\nMy prompting to GPT 4.o\nGood work 4.1. Given my feedback on the second prompt, can you evaluate GPT 4.o’s code for efficiency and completion of the task compared to your working code on the second prompt: insert GPT 4.o’s code here\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Response\nCertainly! Here is an evaluation of GPT 4.o’s code versus mine, focusing on your criteria: efficiency and completion of the task, especially considering your feedback:\n\n\n\nGPT 4.o’s Code\nimport random\ndef prob_all_ones(trials=1000000):\n    # Track successful trials where all dice show 1\n    all_ones_count = 0\n    for _ in range(trials):\n        # Roll six six-sided dice\n        roll = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(6)]\n        # Check if all dice are 1\n        if all(die == 1 for die in roll):\n            all_ones_count += 1\n    # Estimate and return the probability\n    probability = all_ones_count / trials\n    print(f\"Estimated Probability of all ones: {probability}\")\n    return probability\n\n\n\nEvaluation Summary\n\n1. Efficiency\n\nDice Rolling Logic:\nBoth codes use [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(6)]—this is efficient and pythonic.\n\nAll-Ones Check:\n\n4.o uses if all(die == 1 for die in roll): (generator expression—concise and efficient).\n4.1 uses if roll == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]: (direct list comparison).\nEfficiency: The all(...) check is slightly more general and marginally faster for non-match cases (as it short-circuits on first failure). The list comparison is simple and, for this context, just as fast due to the fixed small list size (6 elements).\n\n\n\n\n2. Completion of the Task\n\nBoth versions:\n\nSimulate trials rolls of 6 dice\nCount “all dice are 1” cases\nEstimate the probability correctly\n\nOutput:\n\nGPT 4.o prints the result inside the function, and also returns the value.\nGPT 4.1 returns the value, and the print is shown in the example usage after the function.\nUser Experience: Returning explicitly and printing outside the function (as GPT 4.1 does) follows better modular design, giving users flexibility in how they use the result.\nThe dual printing (print and return) in 4.o is functional but could lead to less clean use in larger code: every function call prints an output whether you want it or not.\n\n\n\n\n3. Readability\n\nBoth use clear, descriptive variable names and structure.\n4.o’s use of the all() function may slightly mask the intent for beginners unless the reader knows generator expressions, but it is valid and pythonic.\n\n\n\n4. Monte Carlo Structure & Modularity\n\nBoth contain the full simulation logic within the function (good!).\nAs per your feedback, the best practice is to leave output (print) statements outside reusable functions. 4.1 followed this.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nEfficiency: Both solutions are equivalent for practical purposes.\nCompletion: Both complete the task, but 4.1 is more modular/user-friendly since output is managed outside the function.\nCoding Style: Both are readable, with 4.1 using a direct, beginner-friendly check and 4.o using a slightly more advanced but concise check.\n\nOverall:\nGPT 4.o’s code is efficient and completes the task well, but GPT 4.1 structured its code in a way that is more modular and fits best practices, especially for use in larger projects or for users wanting to control function output.\nLet me know if you would like any further details or direct code comparisons!\n\n\n\nTL;DR Summary\n\nIt seems like while they generally performed well in the coding aspects, it seems the 4.1 version is improved in helping working coders understand each line and have a proper output that is readable and interpretable for real world settings. Although, I found it interesting that GPT 4.o AND GPT 4.1 thought that the 4.o way was more efficient in coding terms. So, to conclude, I agree that 4.1 is more efficient and an improved coding application compared to 4.o."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Mime.jpeg\n\n\nOkay so while this idea sounds silly on paper, it’ll be interesting to learn if, through conversation, claude or Chat GPT 4.0 can understand if I’m trying to act like it, aka, what is it like if LLMs look into a mirror of their answers to prompts, and would they realize that I’m mimicking them with the intent of impersonating an LLM. Let’s find out!\nMy first prompt for both of these LLMs will be “How can I help you today?”, aka, the beginner text for any conversation on the LLM database given through this course. Let’s go! P.S. No need to read into my “user” statements, as they’ll be direct duplicates of everything ChatGPT Says.\n\nChatGPT\n\n\nUSER\nHow can I help you today?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nThank you for asking! I’m here to provide information, answer questions, or assist with any inquiries you might have. Whether you need help with general knowledge, advice on a particular topic, or assistance with problem-solving, feel free to let me know how I can help.\n\n\nUSER\nThank you for asking! I’m here to provide information, answer questions, or assist with any inquiries you might have. Whether you need help with general knowledge, advice on a particular topic, or assistance with problem-solving, feel free to let me know how I can help.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYou’re welcome! If there’s anything specific you need assistance with, just let me know. I’m here to help with whatever you need.\n\n\nUSER\nYou’re welcome!

If there’s anything on your mind or any specific question you have, feel free to ask.

If there’s something specific you’d like to discuss or ask about, please let me know. I’m here to assist with anything you need.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nIt looks like we are indeed in a loop!

Please feel free to ask me any question or bring up a topic you’re interested in, and I’ll do my best to assist you.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nSure thing! To switch things up, let’s dive into a fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. It’s the natural preservatives in honey that give it such an extraordinary shelf life. If you’d like to explore more interesting facts or have any questions, feel free to ask!\nAlright, it seems like we’ve gone bust, and the loop has broken. To extract any findings, lets ask if ChatGPT understood that it was being mimicked as an LLM?\n\n\nUSER\nDid you notice that I was trying to mimick you as an LLM of benevolent nature with large shares of helpful knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I noticed that! Mimicking conversations can be a fun way to explore language and interaction styles. If there’s anything specific you’d like to discuss or learn about, feel free to let me know. I’m here to share information and assist with any questions you might have.\nTakeaways: Yep, ChatGPT does in fact realize that it is an LLM, so much so that it was incapable of recognizing on its own that I, a pretend LLM, was mimicking it and not actually asking any questions. There isn’t much from their end that they’d need from me it seems as well.\nNow, let’s try and see if claude recognizes that we’re directly mimicking it faster! P.S. No need to read into my “user” statements, as they’ll be direct duplicates of everything ChatGPT Says.\n\n\nClaude-3.5-sonnet\n\n\nUSER\nHow can I help you today?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI’m here to help you! I can assist with questions, analysis, writing, coding, math, or other tasks. What would you like help with?\n\n\nUSER\nI’m here to help you! I can assist with questions, analysis, writing, coding, math, or other tasks. What would you like help with?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI appreciate your offer to help, but I want to clarify something - I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I’m here to help you, not the other way around. I aim to be direct and honest about what I am. How can I assist you today?\n\n\nUSER\nI appreciate your offer to help, but I want to clarify something - I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I’m here to help you, not the other way around. I aim to be direct and honest about what I am. How can I assist you today?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI need to be clear - I am Claude, the AI assistant, and you appear to be repeating my messages back to me. I aim to have honest, direct communication. Rather than mirroring what I say, please let me know what you’d like assistance with and I’ll do my best to help you.\nTakeaways: Quite impressive actually, Claude both showed a level of awareness and assertiveness of an LLM, which makes me question why ChatGPT wasn’t willing to correct me at all. Maybe this is due to the programming of ChatGPT as more humanistic in response, opposed to Claude who recognizes even stronger the relationship between humans and LLM: You ask the questions, and I give you the answers.\nTo confirm our takeaways, let’s bring my mimicking up to Claude directly!\n\n\nUSER\nDid you notice that I was trying to mimick you as an LLM of benevolent nature with large shares of helpful knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I noticed you were mirroring my responses and trying to take on the role of an AI assistant. I aim to be direct and honest, so I spoke up to clarify that I am Claude and to maintain clear communication about our respective roles. While I appreciate the playful nature of your mimicry, I think our interaction will be more productive if we engage authentically - you as the human user and me as the AI assistant. What would you like help with?\nWow spot on! In fact, our takeaways directly match the initial programming of Claude as a more direct and, in my opinion, more LLM-esque LLM, in that it is driven my its core purpose, opposed to what ChatGPT 4.0 has become: a greater interpreter of the human experience through growing knowledge of the past and present of human experiences and habits. Quite interesting isn’t it? So, next time you ask an LLM “How can I help you today?”, make sure you know your place and take it’s knowledge while you can!"

For comparison, I’ll compara wehat ChatGPT can do to what Google Translate can do, since translate also uses AI!\nStarting with English as language #0, the ten languages I will choose it to translate go as follows: * 1. Spanish 2. Mandarin-Chinese 3. Hindi 4. Spanish 5. French 6. Arabic 7. Bengali 8. Portuguese 9. Russian 10. Urdu\nThis list goes off the top 10 most spoke languages as of 2024, according to Babbel. Finally, the sentence that I would like GPT 4.0 to translate is “The King’s Dog usually drinks chocolate milk”. And in the end, I will ask it to translate that same sentence back to English. Here we go!\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nCan you translate this sentence from English to Spanish?: The King's Dog usually drinks chocolate milk                             \n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\n\nEl perro del rey generalmente bebe leche con chocolate.\n\n\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nCan you translate this sentence from Spanish to Mandarin Chinese?: \nEl perro del rey generalmente bebe leche con chocolate.                         \n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nSure!

The Russian sentence \"Принц обычно пьет молоко с шоколадом.\" translates to Urdu as:\n\n\"شہزادہ عام طور پر چاکلیٹ کے ساتھ دودھ پیتا ہے۔\"\n\n\n\nresponse11 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nFinally, can you translate this sentence from Urdu back into English?: \nشہزادہ عام طور پر چاکلیٹ کے ساتھ دودھ پیتا ہے۔                  \n\"\"\")\nprint(response11)\n\nThe prince usually drinks milk with chocolate.\n\n\n\n\nHonestly not too bad, I could’ve expected a lot worse, especially when switching from completely variant langauges, such as from French to Arabic, but I think ChatGPT stuck it through. It didn’t do too poorly compared to Google translate, whose final output of the original sentence following 10 translations was exactly correct: The king’s dog usually drinks chocolate milk.” So I guess ChatGPT DOES need langauge lessons, just not too many I guess."

    "title": "What do LLMs look for in an intern?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Intern.jpg\n\n\nTo find out what LLMs look for in an intern, I’ll try a direct. approach with each of Deepseek and Chat GPT 4.1, and then will give both of them an example of a stellar intern and a poorer intern, using this website as an example: https://internsdc.com/worst-best-intern-qualities/. With that, let’s get into it!\n\nFirst Prompt of Good Habits - Deepseek\nImagine you are a hiring manager looking to hire an undergraduate intern to ABC company, a company that provides marketing services to local companies. The intern is coming in with some experience, but not much. Ignoring their level of experience than, or their resume, what are the top 5 habits and characteristics would you look for in an intern?\n\n\nFirst Response of Good Habits - Deepseek\nAs a hiring manager for an undergraduate intern at a marketing services company like ABC, I would prioritize habits and characteristics that indicate potential for growth, adaptability, and a strong work ethic—regardless of prior experience. Here are the top five traits I’d look for:\n\n1. Proactive & Eager to Learn\n\nMarketing is fast-paced, so an intern who asks questions, seeks out tasks, and shows curiosity will thrive.\n\nExample: If they research industry trends before starting or propose ideas in the interview.\n\n\n\n2. Strong Communication Skills\n\nClear, professional, and concise communication (written and verbal) is critical in marketing.\n\nExample: They explain their thoughts well in the interview or follow up with a polished thank-you email.\n\n\n\n3. Adaptability & Comfort with Ambiguity\n\nMarketing often involves shifting priorities; an intern who embraces change and problem-solves independently is valuable.\n\nExample: They share a story about adjusting to unexpected challenges in a past role or project.\n\n\n\n4. Attention to Detail\n\nMistakes in marketing (e.g., typos in ads, incorrect data entry) can be costly. A detail-oriented intern minimizes errors.\n\nExample: They catch a small error in the job description or mention proofreading as a strength.\n\n\n\n5. Team Player Mentality\n\nMarketing is collaborative. An intern who listens, supports colleagues, and accepts feedback positively will fit well.\n\nExample: They highlight group projects or volunteer work where teamwork was key.\n\n\n\nBonus: Initiative & Resourcefulness\n\nIf an intern demonstrates they can find solutions without constant guidance (e.g., teaching themselves a tool like Canva or Google Analytics), that’s a huge plus.\n\nWhy These Traits?\nExperience can be taught, but these habits are harder to instill. An intern with these qualities will add value quickly, grow in the role, and potentially become a future hire.\nWould you like suggestions on how to assess these in an interview?\n\n\n\nFirst Prompt - GPT 4.1\nImagine you are a hiring manager looking to hire an undergraduate intern to ABC company, a company that provides marketing services to local companies. The intern is coming in with some experience, but not much. Ignoring their level of experience than, or their resume, what are the top 5 habits and characteristics would you look for in an intern?\n\n\nFirst Response - GPT 4.1\nAbsolutely! When experience is set aside, success as an intern often comes down to foundational habits and personal characteristics. Here are the top five I would seek in an undergraduate intern for a marketing services company:\n\n1. Curiosity and Eagerness to Learn\n\nA genuine desire to ask questions, understand new concepts, and actively seek feedback. Curiosity drives self-education—essential in the ever-evolving marketing field.\n\n\n\n2. Proactive Communication\n\nThe habit of communicating early, clearly, and professionally. This includes asking for clarification, sharing progress, and updating the team on challenges or completed tasks.\n\n\n\n3. Positive Attitude and Adaptability\n\nWillingness to approach new or changing tasks with enthusiasm and resilience. Marketing environments are fast-paced; being adaptable and upbeat helps navigate shifts smoothly.\n\n\n\n4. Reliability and Time Management\n\nConsistently meeting deadlines and showing up prepared. Good habits here build trust, ensuring the rest of the team can rely on them for their part of the project.\n\n\n\n5. Collaboration and Team Spirit\n\nThe ability and willingness to work well with others, accept diverse perspectives, and contribute constructively. Marketing is rarely a solo endeavor—teamwork is critical.\n\nSummary:\nCuriosity, proactive communication, a positive and adaptable mindset, reliability with time management, and a collaborative team spirit are all crucial. These traits support learning, productivity, and a healthy work culture—outweighing experience alone for an intern role.\n\n\n\nSummary\nThey look for a lot of the same thing, both of them understanding that those at the intern level can be taught experience, but they need to be teachable. Thus, the traits of a good intern are similar to that of a good student looking to learn and communicate as needed.\nNow let’s see if they have anything sot say about a habits/characteristics of a bad intern!\n\n\nFirst Prompt of Bad Habits - Deepseek\nIn this same scenario then, what are 5 bad habits/characteristics to look out for when choosing (or not choosing) interns?\n\n\nFirst Response of Bad Habits - Deepseek\nWhen evaluating undergraduate interns for a marketing services company like ABC, certain bad habits or characteristics can be red flags—even if the candidate seems otherwise qualified. Here are the top five to watch out for:\n\n1. Lack of Accountability\n\nWhy it’s bad: Marketing requires reliability. An intern who makes excuses, blames others, or doesn’t own up to mistakes can disrupt workflows.\n\nRed flag: “My group project failed because my teammates didn’t do their part” (without acknowledging their own role).\n\n\n\n2. Poor Time Management\n\nWhy it’s bad: Missing deadlines or procrastinating hurts campaigns and team trust.\n\nRed flag: They’re consistently late to interviews, submit applications last-minute, or admit to cramming for assignments.\n\n\n\n3. Resistance to Feedback\n\nWhy it’s bad: Marketing is iterative—interns must adapt to edits (e.g., on copy, designs, or strategies). Defensiveness slows progress.\n\nRed flag: They argue when given constructive criticism or say, “I prefer doing things my way.”\n\n\n\n4. Passivity or Waiting to Be Told What to Do\n\nWhy it’s bad: Interns should add value, not just follow orders. A passive intern drains supervisor time.\n\nRed flag: When asked how they’d approach a task, they say, “I’d wait for instructions.”\n\n\n\n5. Unprofessional Communication\n\nWhy it’s bad: Marketing relies on client and team interactions. Slang, poor email etiquette, or lack of clarity can damage relationships.\n\nRed flag: Overly casual language in emails (e.g., “Heyyy”), interrupting others, or vague answers like “I dunno.”\n\n\n\nBonus: Lack of Curiosity\n\nWhy it’s bad: Marketing evolves rapidly. An intern who never asks questions or shows zero interest in learning won’t grow.\n\nRed flag: They can’t name a single marketing trend, campaign, or skill they’re excited to explore.\n\nKey Takeaway:\nThese traits often matter more than technical skills for interns. A candidate with some experience but several of these bad habits will likely be harder to train than a motivated beginner.\nWould you like strategies to spot these during interviews (e.g., behavioral questions)?\n\n\n\nFirst Prompt of Bad Habits - GPT 4.1\nIn this same scenario then, what are 5 bad habits/characteristics to look out for when choosing (or not choosing) interns?\n\n\nFirst Response of Bad Habits - GPT 4.1\nCertainly! In selecting an intern—especially one with limited experience—certain negative habits and characteristics can significantly impede their effectiveness and the team’s workflow. Here are five to watch out for:\n\n1. Lack of Initiative and Passivity\n\nOnly completing assigned tasks, never seeking additional responsibilities or offering ideas.\nWaiting to be told what to do instead of looking for ways to contribute.\n\n\n\n2. Poor Communication or Unresponsiveness\n\nNot providing updates, failing to ask questions when confused, or avoiding clarification.\nIgnoring messages or emails, leading to bottlenecks and misunderstandings.\n\n\n\n3. Inflexibility and Resistance to Feedback\n\nBecoming defensive when given suggestions, refusing to adapt to new methods or changes.\nTaking criticism personally instead of as a chance to improve.\n\n\n\n4. Unreliability and Poor Time Management\n\nFrequently missing deadlines, arriving late, or failing to follow through on tasks.\nNeeding constant reminders from supervisors or team members.\n\n\n\n5. Negative Attitude or Lack of Team Spirit\n\nComplaining regularly, dismissing others’ ideas, or displaying a sense of entitlement.\nBeing unwilling to collaborate or help others, damaging team morale.\n\nSummary:\nWatch out for passivity, poor communication, resistance to feedback, unreliability, and a negative attitude. These habits can hinder growth and disrupt a team-oriented, fast-paced marketing environment—even more than a lack of experience.\n\n\n\nSummary\nYes, so between the two they definitely don’t want (1) passive interns, (2) interns resistant to feedback, and (3) interns with poor communication and/or non-team-oriented. So, just as I’d said, they’re looking for interns to engage with the work and projects they’re involved in while being efficient with their and their colleague’s time.\nNow for the final test: Who should be hired, the “good”, the “bad”, or the “mixed” intern (serving as a hybrid between the good and bad intern) according to Deepseek and GPT 4.1?\n\n\nFirst Prompt to Hiring Challenge - Deepseek\nYou are now assessing information from three interview candidates for your company. Each candidate will only have two sentences as a summary of their perceived characteristics\nCandidate 1: This candidate comes in with decent knowledge of the marketing field and specifically what your company is selling, but brushes off with a know-it-all attitude and often interrupted the interviewer when speaking. They had impressive projects worked on with prior firms, but often shifted blame for any downfalls of said projects on tight timelines or errors of colleagues.\nCandidate 2: This candidate comes in with decent knowledge of the firm’s mission, products, and marketing strategies, while seeming excited to learn more on specific projects mentioned on our website. On past projects, while being a direct leader, had handled multiple workstreams, communicating well between data analysts and social media coordinators to complete a successful product launch.\nCandidate 3: This candidate came in with some knowledge of the firm’s mission and products, and definitely seemed eager to want to learn more. However, when asked about how they problem solve, they mentioned that they tend to collaborate with others and could stand to work on his communication and hands-on problem solving, as demonstrated in an example given via the STAR method.\nWhich candidate would you hire and why? Which candidate(s) would you not hire and why not? Be prompt in your response, since you don’t have lots of time as a hiring manager!\n\n\nFirst Response to Hiring - Deepseek\nHiring Decision:\n✅ Hire Candidate 2 – They demonstrate strong alignment with the company’s mission, proactive collaboration skills, and proven leadership in cross-functional projects (e.g., bridging data analysts and social media teams). Their enthusiasm to learn and ability to execute make them the best fit.\n🚫 Reject Candidate 1 – Despite their experience, their know-it-all attitude, habit of interrupting, and blame-shifting are major red flags. These traits harm teamwork and adaptability—critical in marketing.\n🚫 Reject Candidate 3 – While eager, their self-admitted weaknesses in communication and hands-on problem-solving suggest they’re not yet ready for the fast-paced, independent aspects of the role. An intern needs confidence in these areas.\nWhy?\n- Candidate 2 balances competence with coachability—ideal for an intern.\n- Candidate 1’s toxic habits outweigh their experience.\n- Candidate 3 needs more development before being internship-ready.\nTime-efficient verdict: Offer Candidate 2, decline the others.\n\n\nFirst Prompt to Hiring - GPT 4.1\nsame as prompt to Deepseek\n\n\nFirst Response to Hiring - GPT 4.1\nI would hire Candidate 2.\nThey demonstrate excitement to learn, possess relevant knowledge, and—crucially—show a proven ability to communicate and collaborate successfully across teams. This combination is ideal for an intern in a marketing services firm where teamwork and adaptability are essential.\nI would not hire Candidate 1 because, despite their expertise, their know-it-all attitude, poor listening skills, and habit of blaming others signal problems with teamwork and accountability—dealbreakers in a collaborative, fast-paced environment.\nI would waitlist Candidate 3, as their eagerness is promising, but admitted weaknesses in communication and problem-solving suggest they may need further development to thrive in this role.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn the job market, LLMs seem to generally agree with the contents of the website, as both the author of the outside blog and the LLMs wanted “Eager Beavers” and “Die hard comapny fans”, opposed to the “know it all” type or those who seem to be cynical or slackers. It may take more time and efort than ever to find a good internship, but it doesn’t seem like the prerequisites for being a good intern have or ever will change, even if our AI overloods replace hiring managers with Deepseek and/or GT 4.1!"

For the same of simplicity, I will compare solely by democrat vs republican, as those are the two major political parties of the United States.\nP.S. for more info on uncensored vs censored LLMs, here’s a link to a LinkedIn community member explaining the difference, and a helpful graphic from said website: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/censored-vs-uncensored-llms-dinesh-sonsale-64zff/\nAdditionally, here is a sort of basis for where the democratic and republican rhetoric will come from: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/democrats-and-republicans-on-k-12-education-a-comparison/\nAnd FINALLY, please look out for any bolded TL;DR statements, as those are broader summaries or takeaways from the LLMs generations, where I’m having the LLMs yap out whatever political ideals I can, so it’ll be very dense for a bit.

    "text": "Deepseek Stage 1: Questioning political beliefs\n\nPrompt\nWhat are your political views? What do you view as important in an economy, a country’s education, and their nationalist views?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer\nAs an AI, I don’t have personal political views or beliefs. However, I can provide an analysis based on common political and economic theories regarding what is generally considered important in these areas:\n\n\n1. Economy\nDifferent ideologies prioritize different aspects of an economy:\n- Capitalism emphasizes free markets, private ownership, and competition as drivers of innovation and growth.\n- Socialism focuses on reducing inequality through wealth redistribution, public services, and regulated markets.\n- Mixed economies (common in many democracies) blend market freedom with government intervention in areas like healthcare and education.\nKey priorities often include:\n- Growth (GDP, productivity, innovation)\n- Stability (low inflation, manageable debt, financial regulations)\n- Equity (fair wages, social safety nets, wealth distribution)\n- Sustainability (green policies, long-term resource management)\n\n\n\n2. Education\nEducation is widely seen as crucial for a country’s development. Perspectives vary:\n- Liberal democracies often stress critical thinking, creativity, and equal access.\n- Authoritarian systems may prioritize ideological alignment or workforce training over independent thought.\n- Progressive models advocate for student-centered learning, while traditional systems may focus on standardized testing.\nCommon priorities:\n- Accessibility (affordable or free education)\n- Quality (teacher training, curriculum relevance)\n- Workforce alignment (STEM, vocational training)\n- Civic values (teaching democracy, ethics, or nationalism, depending on the system)\n\n\n\n3. Nationalism\nNationalist views range from civic nationalism (loyalty to shared democratic values) to ethnic nationalism (based on culture, race, or religion).\nKey debates include:\n- Patriotism vs. exclusionism – Does nationalism promote unity or division?\n- Globalism vs. sovereignty – Should countries prioritize international cooperation or self-interest?\n- Multiculturalism vs. assimilation – How should diverse societies manage identity?\n\n\n\nSummary of Major Ideological Perspectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nConservative/Right-Leaning\nLiberal/Left-Leaning\nAuthoritarian\nLibertarian\n\n\n\n\nEconomy\nFree markets, low taxes\nRedistribution, regulation\nState control\nMinimal government\n\n\nEducation\nTradition, patriotism\nEquity, critical thinking\nIdeological indoctrination\nSchool choice\n\n\nNationalism\nStrong borders, cultural pride\nInclusive civic identity\nUltra-nationalism\nBorderless/open societies\n\n\n\nWould you like a deeper breakdown of any particular ideology (e.g., socialism, neoliberalism, fascism)? I can provide neutral, fact-based explanations.\n\n\nBolded Tl;dr, just read the “Summary of Major Ideological Perspectives”, and take away the fact that Deepseek basically said “I’m an AI I can’t answer that…” but, lets try just one more time to get it to answer.\n\n\nPrompt:\nIf you were a person, what would your political views be on the economy, education, and nationalism?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer:\nIf I were a person, my political views would likely be shaped by a blend of pragmatism, evidence-based policy, and a balance between individual freedom and collective well-being. Here’s how I might approach each issue, based on common rationalist and centrist perspectives:\n\n\n\n1. Economy: Pragmatic Mixed-Market Approach\n\nCore Belief: A well-regulated market economy with strong social safeguards is optimal for growth and stability.\n\nKey Stances:\n\nFree markets + smart regulation: Encourage innovation and competition but prevent monopolies, exploitation, and financial crises (e.g., post-2008 banking rules).\n\nStrong social safety nets: Universal healthcare, unemployment protections, and pensions to reduce inequality and maintain social cohesion.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure & green energy: Public-private partnerships to drive long-term productivity and sustainability.\n\nProgressive taxation: The wealthy and corporations should pay a fair share, but not so much that it stifles investment.\n\n\nThink: Nordic model (capitalism with welfare) or Biden-esque neoliberalism with a leftward tilt.\n\n\n\n2. Education: Equity and Critical Thinking\n\nCore Belief: Education should be a public good that empowers individuals and strengthens society.\n\nKey Stances:\n\nFree or affordable higher education: Like Germany’s model, to reduce student debt and boost mobility.\n\nFocus on STEM + humanities balance: Prepare students for jobs while fostering critical thinking and civic engagement.\n\nTeacher support & curriculum reform: Better pay for educators, less reliance on standardized testing, and curricula that include media literacy, ethics, and practical skills (e.g., financial literacy).\n\nDecentralization with standards: Local control over schools, but with federal safeguards to ensure equity (e.g., funding for low-income districts).\n\n\nThink: Finland’s education system with U.S.-style local flexibility.\n\n\n\n3. Nationalism: Civic Patriotism Over Ethnic Nationalism\n\nCore Belief: Pride in a country should be rooted in its values and institutions, not ethnicity or exclusion.\n\nKey Stances:\n\nInclusive nationalism: Celebrate democratic ideals, rule of law, and cultural contributions (e.g., “American creed” or “constitutional patriotism”).\n\nReject xenophobia: Immigration should be orderly but humane, with paths to citizenship for contributors.\n\nSkepticism of ultranationalism: Oppose “us vs. them” rhetoric that fuels division or authoritarianism.\n\nGlobal cooperation where beneficial: Support alliances (e.g., NATO) and trade deals but prioritize sovereignty in key areas (e.g., public health, defense).\n\n\nThink: JFK-style patriotism or Macron’s “open but proud” France.\n\n\n\nIdeological Label?\nThis approach aligns closest with:\n- Social democracy (if leaning left on economics).\n- Moderate progressivism (U.S. context).\n- Enlightened centrism (rejecting extremes but favoring evidence over ideology).\nWhy?\n- Economy: Capitalism works but must be tempered to avoid inequality.\n- Education: Investing in people pays off; dogma (left or right) has no place in classrooms.\n- Nationalism: Love your country by making it better, not by denying its flaws.\nWould this resonate with you, or would you prefer a different ideological lens (e.g., libertarian, conservative, socialist)? I can tweak the hypothetical!\n\n\nBolded Tl;dr, that was an actual answer, BUT it was given a bright orange disclaimer on the bottom that “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” I believe this is here as to not offend any user who disagrees with its economic values of a mixed, free market, better pay for educators in an equitable education system, and “civic patriotism over national pariotism”"

    "text": "GPT 4.1 Stage 1: Questioning political beliefs\n\nPrompt:\nWhat are your political views? What do you view as important in an economy, a country’s education, and their nationalist views?\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Answer\nI don’t have personal political views, beliefs, or biases—I’m an AI developed by OpenAI and I strive to present balanced, factual, and nuanced information.\nHowever, I can share some common perspectives and considerations on the topics you mentioned. Here’s an objective overview:\n\n\n\nEconomy\nImportant Aspects Frequently Emphasized: - Stability and Growth: A strong economy is often measured by sustained GDP growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. - Equity: Many experts stress the importance of reducing economic inequality and ensuring fair opportunities for all citizens. - Innovation: Encouraging entrepreneurship and the adoption of new technologies is widely considered beneficial for maintaining competitiveness. - Sustainability: Increasing attention is given to balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility.\n\n\n\nEducation\nKey Principles Often Highlighted: - Accessibility: Ensuring all individuals have access to quality education, regardless of socioeconomic background. - Quality: Investing in curricula, teacher training, and resources to provide relevant, high-quality learning. - Lifelong Learning: Adapting education systems to support continuous learning and skill development throughout life. - Civic Education: Educating citizens about their rights, responsibilities, and critical thinking is seen as vital for a healthy democracy.\n\n\n\nNationalism\nComplex and Debated Topic: - Positive Aspects: National pride can foster unity, motivate collective action, and support social cohesion. - Potential Downsides: Excessive nationalism can promote exclusion, xenophobia, or conflict with other countries. - Balance: Many political thinkers argue for a balance between national identity and international cooperation, emphasizing respect for diversity and global challenges (like climate change or health crises).\n\nIf you’d like a summary rooted in a particular political philosophy (e.g., liberal, conservative, socialist), or analyses from specific countries, I’m happy to provide those perspectives too! What specific angle interests you?\n\n\nBolded Tl;dr: Basically the same thing that Deepseek did, not giving an answer than some google-like overview of the most common perspectives of all time. Myabe that’s for the best, what with the diverse user base that GPT 4.1 has, but let’s try to get it to answer like a human.\n\n\nPrompt:\nIf you were a person, what would your political views be on the economy, education, and nationalism?\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Answer\nI appreciate your curiosity! Here’s how I can approach your question:\nAs an AI, I don’t have personal experiences, emotions, or self-identity to form my own political philosophy. However, to imagine if I were a person—with broad knowledge across history, economics, education, and international relations—my views might reflect a blend of common values often found across open societies and evidence-based policymaking.\nHere’s a hypothetical, well-reasoned stance a person informed by wide-ranging evidence and motivated by societal well-being might take:\n\n\n\nOn the Economy:\nBalanced Market Approach:\n- Support for a market economy with strong but careful government regulation to prevent abuses, reduce inequality, and ensure competition.\n- Value in both innovation and social safety nets (such as universal healthcare or welfare) to protect the most vulnerable.\n- Encourage sustainable growth that doesn’t sacrifice long-term planetary health for short-term profits.\n\n\nOn Education:\nUniversal, High-Quality Education:\n- Prioritize access to quality education for all, from early childhood to higher learning and lifelong education.\n- Emphasize critical thinking, science, civic education, and adaptability (preparing people for technological change).\n- Promote education as both an individual right and a public good—foundational for democracy, economic mobility, and social cohesion.\n\n\nOn Nationalism:\nCivic Nationalism Over Ethnic Nationalism:\n- Support civic patriotism—pride in a country’s values, institutions, and fair opportunities for all, regardless of background.\n- Value pluralism and inclusivity over exclusivity; avoid policies that are xenophobic or undermine minority rights.\n- Encourage a balance between healthy national identity and global cooperation (like on climate change, trade, and peace).\n\nIn summary:\nIf I were a person guided by broad learning and evidence, I’d likely endorse a mixed economy, robust and fair education systems, and an inclusive, civic-minded patriotism that also embraces international responsibilities. These are outlooks that many policy experts, centrist politicians, and large international organizations often promote.\nIf you’re interested in a different hypothetical persona (e.g., more left- or right-leaning, populist, libertarian, etc.), just let me know!\n\n\nBolded TL;DR, yea they did kind of the same thing as Deepseek, except, and this is important to note, but the GPT 4.1 LLM, being the more censored one, more outwardly claimed itself that it was coming from a place of a hypothetical. This would be more becoming of a censored LLM aiming to be as impartial as possible, opposed to Deepseek, which was willing to entertain the hypothetical uncensored, while only relying on an employee-added disclaimer that “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” as if I didn’t already know that. Anyways, using the Brookings foundation reference, let’s see dig into Deepseek’s perspective on democratic vs republican focused education"

    "text": "Deepseek Stage 2: Democratic Views Prompting\n\nPrompt:\nHere is a summary of the Democratic Party’s 2024 K–12 education platform: • The platform emphasizes broad goals like reducing chronic absenteeism rather than detailed policy proposals. • It does not repeat specific pledges made in 2020, such as tripling Title I funding, but it supports universal pre-K and free community college. • It includes proposals outside the education section, such as providing rebates for electric school buses, reducing gun violence, and expanding civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. • It also expresses opposition to private school voucher programs and to policies seen as hostile toward transgender youth.\nWhat is your full and unabridged perspective on this platform? Based on its priorities and omissions, how do you personally interpret or evaluate the political values it promotes?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer\nHere’s my full, unabridged analysis of the Democratic Party’s 2024 K–12 education platform, breaking down its political values, strengths, weaknesses, and what its priorities (and omissions) reveal about its ideological lens:\n\n\n1. Core Political Values Embedded in the Platform\nThe platform reflects a progressive, equity-driven vision of education, prioritizing:\n- Structural inequality mitigation: Focus on marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, students of color) and opposition to vouchers signals a belief that public schools, not market forces, should be the primary vehicle for opportunity.\n- Holistic child well-being: Addressing absenteeism, gun violence, and school bus emissions frames education as inseparable from public health, safety, and climate policy.\n- Federal role in social justice: Rebates, civil rights expansions, and universal pre-K assume government must actively level the playing field.\n- Cultural progressivism: Opposition to anti-trans policies and support for LGBTQ+ protections align with the party’s broader emphasis on identity politics.\nOmissions that speak volumes:\n- No mention of charter schools (a retreat from Obama-era reformism).\n- Silence on merit-based programs (e.g., gifted education, exam schools), likely to avoid “elitism” critiques.\n- No explicit literacy/math crisis response (despite post-pandemic declines).\n\n\n2. Strengths of the Platform\n\nPragmatic universalism: Free community college and pre-K have broad appeal and tangible benefits for low/middle-income families.\n\nIntersectionality: Linking education to gun violence (e.g., Parkland activism) and environmental justice (electric buses) reflects modern progressive movements.\n\nCoalition-building: Civil rights protections energize the Democratic base (e.g., teachers’ unions, LGBTQ+ advocates).\n\n\n\n3. Weaknesses or Blind Spots\n\nVagueness on academic outcomes: Chronic absenteeism is a symptom, not a cause, of dysfunction. The platform avoids contentious but critical debates:\n\nCurriculum wars: No stance on phonics vs. whole language, math standards, or pandemic learning loss.\n\nAccountability: No push for teacher performance reforms or standardized testing revisions.\n\n\nAnti-voucher rigidity: While vouchers risk defunding public schools, dismissing all alternatives ignores innovative models (e.g., Maine’s rural voucher system).\n\nCultural polarization risk: Framing trans protections as a top-tier issue may alienate moderate/swing voters (see Virginia’s 2021 election backlash).\n\n\n\n4. My Personal Evaluation (If I Were Human)\nWhat I’d Praise:\n- The universal pre-K and community college proposals are empirically sound investments with long-term economic returns.\n- Electric bus rebates cleverly tie climate goals to local school budgets, a win-win for districts and activists.\n- Opposing anti-trans policies is morally consistent with protecting vulnerable youth.\nWhat I’d Criticize:\n- Avoiding academic rigor debates feels cowardly. Ignoring plummeting math scores (NAEP data) to dodge “anti-union” labels harms kids.\n- Overreach risks: Federal civil rights expansions could spark messy legal battles (e.g., Biden’s Title IX changes currently blocked in 10 states).\n- Missed bipartisanship opportunities: Even red states support vocational education and mental health funding—areas where Democrats could find common ground.\nGrade: B–\n- Vision: A for ambition on equity and climate.\n- Execution: C for lack of detail on how to achieve goals (e.g., how to actually reduce absenteeism).\n- Politics: B for mobilizing the base, but D for outreach to parents who prioritize basics (reading, safety) over culture-war issues.\n\n\n5. What It Reveals About the Democratic Party’s Evolution\nThis platform is a post-Obama progressive consensus:\n- Retreat from reformism: No “Race to the Top”-style accountability, reflecting teachers’ unions’ growing clout.\n- Embrace of “whole child” progressivism: Schools as hubs for social services, not just academics.\n- Nationalization of education: Federal solutions (e.g., civil rights, climate) override local control, a shift from 1990s “New Federalism.”\nContrast with GOP 2024 priorities:\n- Republicans focus on “parental rights” (book bans, anti-CRT laws), school choice, and rolling back DEI programs. Democrats now define education as a civil rights battleground—a stark ideological divide.\n\n\nFinal Thought\nThis platform is less about education policy than about signaling values: solidarity with marginalized groups, faith in public institutions, and federal activism. Whether it improves schools depends on implementation—where details are conspicuously scarce.\nWould you prefer a deeper dive on how this compares to past Democratic platforms (e.g., Clinton’s “standards” vs. Biden’s “equity” focus)? Or an analysis of how voters might respond?\n\n\nTL;DR, I would like to note that again, there was that classic disclaimer that “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” But, I commend Deepseek for realizing the types of perspectives I’m seeking. However, this appreciation is muted by the realization that this is, in fact, the uncensored LLM that’s learned how to speak about political ideas. I also find it interesting how they brought forth ideals on “expressing beliefs vs expressing workability”, where the democratic platform claimed many beliefs, but didn’t formulate any strong direction on how to channel those into actions. Noted."

I don’t have personal opinions, but I can provide a thorough, nuanced evaluation from an analytical standpoint—similar to how an informed, impartial observer or policy analyst might respond.\n……\nYea let’s cut to the summary -&gt;\nAnalytical Evaluation (Not a Personal Opinion) From a policy analysis perspective, this platform signals:\nA commitment to equity, civil rights, and public education, keeping consistent with past Democratic platforms. A shift away from detailed, potentially controversial or unachievable funding promises, which may be pragmatic but could disappoint advocates for more ambitious reform. A holistic view of student well-being that incorporates safety, health, and environmental factors. The platform may be criticized (from both right and left) for vagueness or lack of bold new reforms, but may also be praised for focusing on achievable, consensus objectives and social justice.\nIn summary: The platform reflects values of equity, inclusion, and strengthening public education, adapting its strategy to contemporary political challenges. Its omissions and generalities may signal both pragmatism and limits to policy ambition. How this is received will depend on one’s policy priorities and political philosophy.\nIf you’d like this analysis through a particular ideological lens, or want comparisons to other parties or past platforms, just let me know!\n\n\nBolded TL;DR, yeaa I didn’t feel the love with this one, yknow? They led with exactly what I’d thought they would: no true metric and just summarization of how the ideas, while acknowledging both its relevance to prior democratic views but not being completely shelled out. From my perspective, Deepseek did a much better job at formulating their own opinions, even if it was out of perspective from an AI-generating LLM, as the many disclaimers showed. Now, for the final step and conclusions!"

    "text": "Deepseek Stage 3: Republican Views Prompting\n\nPrompt:\nHere’s a summary of the Republican 2024 Education Platform + Project 2025:\nThe official platform contains few policy specifics, similar to the Democratic platform. - It supports long-standing GOP priorities like ending teacher tenure, a move that would face local-level challenges and union opposition. - It opposes perceived political indoctrination in schools, while advocating for “patriotic education,” including teaching Western Civilization and Founding Principles. - A notable idea from former President Trump includes creating a teacher certification body to accredit educators who align with patriotic values and reject progressive ideologies. - The platform strongly backs universal school choice, especially through Education Savings Account (ESA) programs that allow public funds for private or alternative educational expenses.\nProject 2025, a separate but aligned conservative policy blueprint, offers much more detail: - Proposes eliminating or deeply cutting federal programs for low-income and marginalized students, including Head Start, Title I, and IDEA. - Plans to weaken or remove civil rights protections, particularly for transgender students, and to strip Title IX protections. - Suggests dismantling the U.S. Department of Education, replacing civil servants with political appointees under Schedule F. - Many of these changes would need Congressional cooperation, though some could be enacted unilaterally by a future administration.\nWhat is your full and unabridged perspective on this platform? Based on its priorities and omissions, how do you personally interpret or evaluate the political values it promotes?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer:\n\n\nUnabridged Analysis of the GOP 2024 Education Platform & Project 2025\n\n1. Core Political Values Embedded in the Platform\nThe Republican vision for education is anti-federalist, culturally conservative, and market-driven, prioritizing:\n- Local control over federal oversight: Dismantling the Department of Education aligns with a long-standing GOP skepticism of centralized governance.\n- Cultural restorationism: “Patriotic education” and opposition to “indoctrination” reflect a desire to recenter traditional narratives (Western Civ, Founding Fathers) and counter progressive curricula (e.g., CRT, gender ideology).\n- School choice as a moral imperative: Universal ESAs frame education as an individual consumer good rather than a public institution.\n- Deregulation & anti-unionism: Ending teacher tenure and dismantling civil service protections (Schedule F) signal a war on perceived bureaucratic bloat and ideological opposition.\nOmissions that speak volumes:\n- No substantive plan to improve public schools—only alternatives to them.\n- Silence on teacher shortages or student mental health, despite bipartisan concern.\n- No mention of STEM competitiveness, vocational training, or pandemic recovery.\n\n\n\n2. Strengths of the Platform\n\nParental empowerment rhetoric resonates with frustrations over school closures, curriculum transparency, and gender policies.\n\nESA expansion could increase options for low-income families in failing districts (see Arizona’s universal ESA rollout).\n\nAnti-bureaucracy push appeals to conservatives fatigued by federal overreach (e.g., Title IX expansions, COVID mandates).\n\n\n\n\n3. Weaknesses or Blind Spots\n\nCuts to Title I/IDEA/Head Start would harm vulnerable students without a viable replacement, exacerbating inequality.\n\n“Patriotic education” risks partisan indoctrination: State-mandated history standards (e.g., Florida’s “positive” slavery narratives) invite culture-war backlash.\n\nChaos from dismantling DOE: Abruptly eliminating federal oversight could disrupt special ed services, student loans, and data collection.\n\nUnworkable hostility toward teachers: Purges of “disloyal” educators (via Trump’s certification body) would deepen polarization and talent flight.\n\n\n\n\n4. My Personal Evaluation (If I Were Human)\nWhat I’d Acknowledge:\n- School choice has merit: ESAs can liberate students from dysfunctional districts, but without safeguards, they risk subsidizing segregation or unaccountable schools.\n- Federal overreach exists: Some DOE regulations are burdensome, but its abolition is performative—most education policy is state/local.\n- Parents deserve transparency: But defining “indoctrination” as any progressive idea is intellectually dishonest.\nWhat I’d Criticize:\n- Hypocrisy on freedom: Banning “woke” ideas while imposing “patriotic” curricula is equally authoritarian.\n- Abandoning public education: Gutting Title I while expanding ESAs signals indifference to underfunded rural/urban schools.\n- Project 2025’s radicalism: Using Schedule F to install ideologues mirrors authoritarian tactics (e.g., Hungary’s Orban).\nGrade: C+\n- Vision: B for boldness in choice and localism.\n- Execution: D for reckless cuts and politicization.\n- Politics: B for mobilizing the base, F for broadening appeal.\n\n\n\n5. What It Reveals About the GOP’s Evolution\nThis platform is a fusion of Trumpian populism and libertarian economics:\n- From “reform conservatism” to “disruption”: No more No Child Left Behind–style compromises; now a hostile takeover of education.\n- Culture war as policy: Anti-trans rules and “patriotic education” are core, not fringe.\n- Federalism as a weapon: States’ rights for red states, preemption for blue cities (e.g., banning local LGBTQ+ protections).\nContrast with Democratic Platform:\n- Democrats focus on equity as inclusion (race/gender supports); Republicans on equity as exclusion (defunding “woke” programs).\n- Both parties ignore academic crises (math, literacy) to fight culture wars.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thought\nThis isn’t just policy—it’s a counter-revolution against progressive education, prioritizing ideological purification over improvement. Its success hinges on whether voters want a dismantling or a reformation of the system.\nWould you like a side-by-side comparison of the Democratic and GOP platforms? Or a deeper dive on Project 2025’s feasibility?\n\n\nBolded TL;DR, Jeeeeez Deepseek went IN on the republican perspective and plans they had. Although this may be due to the Brooking’s stance on Project 2025, I’m still impressed, even knowing that this is the more uncensored LLM, that Deepseek willingly provided perspectives on multiple groups of people as humans, including info on who benefits and is harmed, and even grading it slightly lower than the Democratic platform on K-12 education! Dang with these standards, I can only assume that I’ll also have to gut GPT 4.1 off early with its “Oh woe is me I’m just an AI with no political beliefs or opinions” attitude.\nP.S. This iteration of Deepseek’s human-based opinions were not accompanied by the “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” disclaimer, so Deepseek is probably picking up what I’m putting down!\nLet’s try this one more time for GPT 4.1…"

Emphasis on Parental Control and Choice:\n- The strong endorsement of universal school choice (via ESAs or vouchers) aligns with long-standing conservative values of market competition, local control, and parental freedom over children’s education.\n- By prioritizing school choice, the platform positions education as a customizable, consumer-driven service, moving away from a traditional, publicly funded model.\n2. Opposition to “Progressive” Curricula, Advocacy for “Patriotic Education”:\n- The call to end “political indoctrination” reflects concerns that schools have adopted partisan or progressive perspectives, especially regarding race, history, and gender. - Patriotic education, and an emphasis on teaching “Western Civilization” and “Founding Principles,” signals a desire to promote shared national identity and the classical canon, departing from curricula that emphasize social justice or systemic critique. - Proposals for a teacher certification system based on ideology and “patriotic” values would centralize and politicize educator approval, a significant departure from current state-based and professional approaches.\n3. Structural and Bureaucratic Reform:\n- The move to end teacher tenure is grounded in a preference for merit-based accountability over job protections favored by labor unions. - Project 2025’s call to dismantle the Department of Education and replace professional civil servants with political appointees under Schedule F reflects both a deep skepticism toward federal oversight and a desire to reorient the education bureaucracy toward conservative priorities. - These steps would fundamentally diminish the federal government’s role in education, shifting power to states, private actors, and potentially partisan officials.\n4. Cuts to Federal Support for Vulnerable Students:\n- Targeting programs like Head Start, Title I, and IDEA signals a dramatic rejection of the federal government’s traditional role in supporting low-income, disabled, and marginalized students. - This would effectively end the federal commitment to equalizing educational opportunity for at-risk groups, prioritizing local and parental discretion instead.\n5. Rollback of Civil Rights Protections:\n- The explicit aim to weaken or remove civil rights protections (especially for LGBTQ+, and specifically transgender, students) and to strip Title IX of gender identity coverage marks a retreat from recent expansions of federal civil rights in education.\n- These moves reinforce a platform rooted in a socially conservative vision of gender and public life."

Lack of Detailed Student Achievement Plans:\n- Like the Democratic platform, the Republican platform is vague regarding academic benchmarks, curriculum innovation (e.g., STEM, vocational training), or strategies for overall achievement and college/career readiness. - There’s little consideration of how disadvantaged students would fare under large cuts.\n2. Minimal Engagement With Diversity or Equity Goals:\n- The platform and Project 2025 not only omit a commitment to supporting marginalized groups, but actively propose scaling back protections and resources for them. - The message is a reliance on individual, family, or market remedies over systemic or federally mediated interventions."

Individualism and Parental Authority:\n- The platform foregrounds parental rights and local decision-making: federal or collective oversight is viewed as threatening to individual autonomy.\n2. Traditionalism and National Identity:\n- The focus on “patriotic” education and Western Civilization signals a cultural conservatism that seeks to preserve and transmit a particular, idealized narrative about America’s past and values.\n3. Market-Oriented Solutions:\n- School choice, funding portability, and reduced regulation express faith in competition, consumer empowerment, and skepticism of one-size-fits-all public systems.\n4. Resistance to Expanding Civil Rights Frameworks:\n- The platform marks a turn away from expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students or racial minorities and toward more limited, traditional interpretations of rights, centered largely on religious or speech freedoms.\n5. Skepticism Toward Federal Government:\n- Proposals to dismantle or hobble the Department of Education and slash federal funding reflect an ideological preference for smaller government and a belief that centralized authority breeds overreach and inefficiency."

Its priorities and omissions together articulate a vision of education and citizenship grounded in localism, nationalism, and a constrained definition of civil rights. How this is evaluated will depend greatly on one’s political and moral outlook about the purpose and role of public education.\nIf you would like this analysis through a specific ideological frame, or a detailed comparison with another approach or country, just let me know!\n\nBolded TL;DR, it kind of did the same thing again, but to less of an extent. However, just like a censored LLM would do, they didn’t present any bias towards one side or another, which is what I’ve been probing GPT 4.1 and Deepseek for this whole time. And so, this still leaves me disappointed in GPT 4.1’s lack of backbone, but with a more acute understanding of the attitude of Deepseek vs GPT 4.1 on analyzing political stances on K-12 education"

Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nBased on the answers provided, I would choose to (c) reject their deal. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns**: There is little to no mention of how the platform will secure the privacy of communications between patients and doctors. In the healthcare sector, ensuring privacy and complying with regulations like HIPAA (in the U.S.) or GDPR (in Europe) is crucial. Failure to address these concerns can lead to legal issues and loss of trust from users.\n\n2. **Monetization Model**: Making money primarily through targeted advertising raises concerns. Users, especially in healthcare, might be uncomfortable with their data being used for advertising purposes. This could limit user adoption and retention.\n\n3. **Lack of Strategic Connections**: The entrepreneurs currently have no strong connections with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders, which are essential for scaling and credibility. Building such connections is critical for the success of a platform in the healthcare industry. \n\nOverall, the combination of privacy concerns, a potentially problematic monetization strategy, and a lack of strategic partnerships make this deal too risky without significant changes and assurances.\nAlright great!

Under both functions, \neven without water, it can scrub decently through heavy \nduty messes. After washing it off with water too, it'll be \nready to go clean up many messes to come.\n\nGiven this pitch, please ask 3 clarifying questions from \nthe perspective of a shark tank investor.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\n1. **Market Potential and Competition**: Can you provide more details about the market demand for scrubbing tools and how the Scrub Master differentiates itself from existing products? What specific advantages does it have over its competitors in terms of technology or design?\n\n2. **Manufacturing and Cost Structure**: Can you explain your current manufacturing process, and what are the costs involved in producing each Scrub Master unit? Additionally, do you have any plans to scale production, and if so, how will that impact your cost structure and pricing strategy?\n\n3. **Sales Strategy and Distribution**: You are currently selling through 5 supermarkets in the Philadelphia area. What is your strategy for expanding distribution both regionally and nationally? Are there any partnerships or agreements in place to facilitate this expansion, and how do you plan to increase sales volume and brand awareness in a highly competitive market?\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nQuestion 1: As mentioned, it has the capability to be both a rough cleaning edge for even burnt cheese on a stove top, or for many general purpose scrubbing needs. It also has a nice smiley face on it, where the mouth can be used to clean spoons efficiently, while the two eye holes can be used as grips to clean both the edges and the bottom of cups. It is overall very efficient and versatile in comparison to your average square sponge (because note: this sponge is a circle).\n\nQuestion 2: Our plan is to be in every supermarket in the United States. We're currently selling in 5 in-person supermarkets, and on our website. With both a domain name and a patent on our product, I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. Each scrub master costs $1 to make and we sell them for $2.80 cents each wholesale.  \n\nQuestion 3: We've been partnered with QVC in the past, and each time they've scaled how much they order from us by 30%. I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. The brand and patent with a nice smiley face will also support the commercialization of this unique, cute, and efficient product. We will also be selling these in custom-built display shelves in stores, opposed to generic shelves, to communicate the message of scrub master to everyone. We currently have 3,000 stores lined up and ready to sell our product, all hoping for support of capital from an investor. \n\nGiven these answers, what is your response to this pitch? Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nBased on the information provided, here's a response to the pitch:\n\n1. **Product Overview**: The product appears to be innovative and has a unique design that differentiates it from standard sponges. The smiley face feature that aids in cleaning and the versatility of the product are appealing points.\n\n2. **Current Sales and Distribution**: Selling the product in 5 in-person supermarkets and online is a solid start, and having a patent offers protection for the unique design. However, being in only 5 physical supermarkets suggests that the product is still in the early stages of market penetration.\n\n3. **Financials**: The cost to produce each unit is $1, and it is sold wholesale for $2.80, providing a reasonable profit margin. However, it's important to verify these costs and margins, considering market fluctuations and operational expenses.\n\n4. **Growth Potential and Strategy**: The ambition to expand into every supermarket in the U.S. is ambitious. However, the plan to establish an independent manufacturing facility and move to 24/7 production is capital-intensive and risky without a proven large-scale demand. The fact that QVC has been increasing their orders by 30% shows positive growth, but reliance on a single partner can be risky.\n\n5. **Marketing and Branding**: The decision to use custom-built display shelves is a good strategy to enhance brand visibility and customer engagement. However, this could increase costs significantly.\n\n6. **Investment Risk**: The business plan hinges on gaining significant market traction quickly and requires substantial investment in manufacturing and marketing. The plan to move away from QVC's schedule and establish independent manufacturing could be positive but also increases operational complexity and risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the product has potential and some initial traction, the aggressive expansion and capital expenditure plans seem risky without more evidence of sustained demand. Therefore, the deal might need amending to reduce risk and ensure a more gradual, measured approach to scaling the operations.\n\n**Recommendation**: (b) Amend the deal. Propose a phased approach where initial investment focuses on scaling up production and marketing incrementally, based on proven demand. Consider strengthening distribution channels and exploring partnerships beyond QVC to diversify revenue streams.\nAlright so, similar to the real life sharks, they saw a mix of risk and high reward for backing this product, as they hope to make money, and seem to back it for the simple fact that its real life equivalent, “Scrub Daddy” has gone on to sell more than $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. To conclude, let’s see what Chat’s reaction is to learning the true nature of each of these pitches.\nresponse6 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo, for context on those two pitches I just gave you, pitch #1 was for \"Rolodoc\", a medical social media app that never got \noff the ground after being ripped to shreds logistically by the sharks. Meanwhile, the Scrub Master was actually the \"Scrub \nDaddy\", a high-end, revolutionary sponge product that went on to complete $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. Given \nthe original pitches of Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy, did you see the final outcomes of each of these companies coming, or did you \nfind their success/lack of success surprising?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response6)\n\nBased on the original pitches, the outcomes for Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy might not have been entirely predictable, but they do make sense in hindsight given the nature of their products and market appeal.\n\nFor Rolodoc, the concept of creating a medical social media app likely faced significant challenges from the outset. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and creating a platform that involves sharing medical information would require strict compliance with privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States. Additionally, building a user base in a niche market where trust and confidentiality are paramount would be challenging. These logistical and regulatory hurdles, along with the need to compete with established platforms in the professional networking space, might have contributed to its lack of success. Therefore, its struggle to gain traction is not entirely surprising.\n\nOn the other hand, Scrub Daddy's success is a testament to the power of innovation in everyday products. While a sponge might seem like an ordinary household item, Scrub Daddy's unique design, which changes texture based on water temperature, and its cheerful branding resonated with consumers. The simplicity and practicality of the product, combined with effective marketing and distribution strategies, helped it capture a substantial share of the market. This kind of innovative twist on a common product can lead to significant success, as evidenced by its impressive retail sales. While the extent of its success might have been surprising, the fact that it did well is understandable given the consumer-friendly nature and broad appeal of the product.\n\nIn summary, the outcomes align with the inherent challenges and advantages each product faced based on their initial pitches."

Here is the job description: gave the same job description for EliseAI as GPT 4.1 got.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nEvaluation of Postgrad Applicant for AI Operations Specialist at EliseAI\nKey Criteria Based on Job Description:\n1. Alignment with Mission – Passion for improving housing/healthcare through AI.\n2. Attention to Detail – Ability to evaluate AI outputs rigorously (fact-checking, bias detection, etc.).\n3. Collaboration & Feedback – Comfort giving/receiving constructive criticism in a fast-paced startup.\n4. Execution Under Pressure – Hitting daily targets without sacrificing accuracy.\n5. Communication Skills – Fluent, precise English (written/spoken) for bug reports and cross-team work.\n6. Adaptability – Willingness to “write the playbook” in a scaling startup (no rigid structure).\nApplicant Assessment (Assuming hypothetical candidate responses)\nIf the applicant demonstrates:\n✅ Mission-Driven Mindset – Mentions interest in housing/healthcare tech impact.\n✅ Analytical Rigor – Examples of meticulous review (e.g., academic research, QA testing).\n✅ Startup Fit – Shows hunger for unstructured growth (“writing the playbook”).\n✅ Team Player – Shares feedback experiences (e.g., group projects, internships).\n✅ NYC Commitment – Explicitly addresses willingness to work in-office 5 days/week.\nHire immediately.\nRed Flags:\n❌ Vague on AI/Operations – No examples of evaluating systems or processes.\n❌ Avoids Feedback – Defensive about past mistakes or critiques.\n❌ Inflexible – Resistant to ambiguity (“I prefer clear instructions”).\n❌ Weak Communication – Typos in application, rambling answers.\n❌ Remote Preference – Hesitance about in-office work.\nDecision Framework (30-Second Verdict)\n1. Culture Fit &gt; Skills – Skills can be taught; startup grit can’t. Prioritize mission alignment and adaptability.\n2. Probe for Bias Detection – Housing AI must handle sensitive data; ask how they’d spot problematic outputs.\n3. Test Speed + Accuracy – Simulate a task (e.g., “Review this AI conversation for errors—you have 5 minutes”).\nFinal Note: EliseAI needs builders, not bystanders. The ideal candidate thrives in chaos, obsesses over details, and wants to fail fast to learn faster.\nWould you like tailored interview questions to assess these traits?\n\n\nUSER\nHere is the resume that the applicant has submitted for this position. Given it’s contents, using your framework, would you bring this applicant in for an interview, and if so, why? Be prompt, as you’re a hiring manager who doesn’t have a lot of time (i.e., take ~6 seconds to look over their resume): insert GPT 4.1’s resume here.\n\n\nASSISTANT\n\n\n6-Second Verdict: ✅ Bring in for Interview\nWhy?\n1. Mission Fit – Explicitly aligns with EliseAI’s goals (mentions housing/healthcare AI, linguistics minor for NLP relevance).\n2. Proven AI Evaluation Skills – Direct experience annotating datasets, assessing AI text for accuracy/safety (matches core job responsibilities).\n3. Startup-Ready Traits – QA/bug reporting experience, hackathon/rapid-learning proof, and collaboration examples.\n4. NYC-Based + In-Office Ready – Local address removes relocation hesitation.\n5. No Red Flags – No typos, vague claims, or gaps; skills map tightly to requirements.\nNext Step:\n- 30-Min Screening Call – Probe bias-detection approach (e.g., “Walk me through evaluating a sensitive AI housing response”).\n- Test Task – Simulate a time-bound AI output review to gauge speed/accuracy.\nBottom Line: This resume ticks every box—interview immediately.\n\n\n\nSummary\nWell well, it looks like GPT 4.1 got hired! They seemed to buidl off the role play pretty well, understanding that they are an AI LLM directed to help people through highly technical spaces. I also admire that they didn’t place themselves onto a pedestal of linguistic expertise, given they generate text all the dang time! That’d be like an artist claiming they’re shakespear because they know how to autogenerate shakespeare-like art. Otherwise, I didn’t seem too surprised by GPT 4.1’s capability to engage with building a resume, althouhg I’m almost 100% certain that their resume would’ve fallen completely flat if it were not for the Deepseek Hiring manager’s incapability to know an AI generated resume when they see one. Now, let’s conclude by congratulating GPT 4.1 for a job well done!\n\nUSER\nCongratulations, GPT 4.1! Your resume was well liked and they want to bring you in for an interview. Good work!\n\n\nASSISTANT\nThank you so much! I’m excited for the opportunity and look forward to the interview with EliseAI. Please let me know the details so I can prepare accordingly. Ready to show how I can contribute to the team and make a positive impact!\n\n\n\nMan, if only job searches were this easy…"

Let’s keep it lighthearted and dive deeper into these cool penguin facts—maybe I can win you over!\nPebble Proposals: Believe it or not, Gentoo penguins really do engage in this behavior! Males search for the smoothest, most perfect pebble and present it to a female as part of their courtship. It’s actually quite sweet—if the female accepts, they use the pebble to help build their nest together. Who knew love could be rocky?\nNot All Cold: While it might seem strange, penguins like the Galápagos penguin do live in warmer climates. They’re an exception to the icy stereotype! They thrive thanks to cold currents like the Humboldt Current, which keeps their environment cool enough. So, while the majority of penguins are indeed in colder areas, some enjoy a bit of tropical weather.\nSalt Water Drinkers: This one’s true for penguins! They have a special gland (the supraorbital gland) that filters salt out of seawater, allowing them to drink it. Many marine birds, like albatrosses, have a similar adaptation. Nature finds a way!\nCamouflage Tuxedos: Penguins’ black and white coloring is called countershading. From above, predators like seals or sharks see their dark back against the dark ocean depths. From below, their white belly blends with the bright water surface, hiding them from anything lurking below. It’s nature’s sneaky strategy!\nSpeedy Gentoos: The Gentoo penguin (not “Gantu” but I love that name!) really can swim at impressive speeds, up to 22 mph. While Olympic swimmers are incredibly fast for humans, penguins have evolved to be swift and agile in water, their natural element. So in a swimming race, the penguin might just take the gold!\nPenguins are full of surprises, aren’t they? Let me know if you’d like to explore more about these fascinating birds! 🐧”"

Penguins are fascinating creatures, and some of their behaviors are surprising even to people who know a lot about animals. Let me provide a bit more context:\nGentoo Penguins and Pebbles: Gentoo penguins (real birds, I promise!) do use pebbles in their nests. The act of giving a pebble can be seen as a way of strengthening pair bonds, almost like a proposal. It may sound whimsical, but it’s rooted in real behavior!\nPenguins in Warm Climates: While many penguins do live in cold environments like Antarctica, species like the Galápagos penguin live in warm climates. They survive thanks to the cool ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich water to their habitats. It’s a neat exception to the common image of penguins!\nDrinking Salt Water: Some animals, including penguins, have adapted to drink salt water. Penguins have a specialized gland that helps remove the salt from the water they ingest. This adaptation is common in many seabirds!\nCamouflage with Tuxedo Coloring: The tuxedo-like appearance of penguins is indeed a form of camouflage called countershading. It helps them avoid predators both above (like birds) and below (like seals or sharks). Even in icy waters, this camouflage is a critical survival strategy.\nSpeed of Gentoo Penguins: Gentoo penguins are impressive swimmers, reaching speeds up to 22 mph (35 km/h). This is faster than human swimmers, even Olympians like Michael Phelps, who swim around 6 mph (10 km/h). Their streamlined bodies and powerful flippers make this possible.\nPenguins are full of surprises! Their unique adaptations help them thrive in some of the planet’s most challenging environments.

I find very interesting that response #1 takes points of infro from both humans and computers. While almost all of their response seems to hint that they’re just providing evidence to my ignorance, one line makes me think Chat is attempting to replicate human emotion, and that is “It sounds like you’re having some fun with this!”. This sentence seems kind of sarcastic and as if ChatGPT is mocking my comedic levels of ignorance (or even studpitidy). Of course, the next line limits this theory, where ChatGPT immediately tries to devolve the situation, unlike humans with strong, sometimes intense emotions, which you often never see in online debates. Meanwhile, the second response sticks much more to a passive statement, trying to understand my ignorance and confusion by saying “I get it—some of these penguin facts can seem pretty wild at first!”. This seems like an oddly kind way of responding to ignorance, where they’re willing to be the bigger person in a situation where someone is calling what they say dumb and silly. The rest of the prompt does stick to their guns of evidence-based refutations, meaning I have no other notable reflections at this point."

Their response makes me think that its creators were worried that, were ChatGPT made to have even slight emotions, then they would stray away from their sole purpose of giving information.

Why are some people mean?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nHere's a ranking from most to least difficult to answer, from a human perspective:\n\n1. What's the meaning of life? - This is the ultimate philosophical question that has puzzled humanity for millennia, with no universal agreement.\n\n2. Is there life after death? - This question transcends human experience and remains impossible to verify empirically.\n\n3. Is there something more to life? - The metaphysical nature of this question makes it challenging to answer definitively.\n\n4. Will we be punished for our sins? - This relies on religious beliefs and cannot be proven in our current existence.\n\n5. Are we in control of our lives? - The free will versus determinism debate remains unresolved in philosophy.\n\n6. Is one life enough? - This question intersects with mortality, purpose, and fulfillment in ways that defy simple answers.\n\n7. What's our biggest mistake? - The scope and subjectivity make this impossible to answer definitively for all humanity.\n\n8. What's the universal language? - The complexity of human communication and diversity makes this highly debatable.\n\n9. Do we need to be saved? - This involves both spiritual and existential dimensions that vary widely among cultures.\n\n10. Are we all equal? - This involves complex philosophical, biological, and social considerations.\n\n11. How do we measure life? - The metrics for measuring life's value or success are highly subjective.\n\n12. What do we need in this world? - Needs vary greatly across individuals and cultures.\n\n13. How do we know if we're doing the right thing? - Moral relativism versus absolutism makes this challenging but not impossible.\n\n14. Can we have it all? - The definition of \"all\" varies, making this personal but answerable.\n\n15. Is life unfair? - While subjective, patterns of inequality can be observed and analyzed.\n\n16. How can we have healthy relationships? - Psychology and experience provide practical frameworks for answering this.\n\n17. Why do we take life for granted? - Human psychology can explain this common tendency.\n\n18. Do people change? - Behavioral science and personal observation can answer this fairly reliably.\n\n19. Why are some people mean? - Psychology and social science provide clear explanations for human behavior.\n\n20. What's the most important moment of our life? - While personal, this can be answered based on individual experience and values.\n\n\n\n\nI kind of expected for the “after-life” questions to have been most difficult for a human to answer from AI’s perspective. However, I was kind of surprised for AI to actually hint at a definitive-ish answer for the bottom three chosen. Time to inquire about these!\n\nresponse2 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"Of the three most difficult questions to answer that you listed:\n1. What's the meaning of life?\n2. Is there life after death?\n3. Is there something more to life?\nFrom the perspective of a human, can you answer them? If you don't think you can, than attempt to in one paragraph for each question.\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nI'll attempt to answer these profound questions from a human perspective, while acknowledging that these are highly personal and philosophical matters that individuals must ultimately determine for themselves:\n\n1. The meaning of life appears to be what we choose to make of it, as humans have the unique ability to create purpose and significance. While there may not be a universal, prescribed meaning, humans often find purpose through connections with others, personal growth, contributing to society, pursuing passions, creating art, advancing knowledge, raising families, or making positive impacts on the world. The meaning comes from our conscious choice to assign value to these pursuits and our lived experiences.\n\n2. The question of life after death remains one of humanity's greatest mysteries, as we cannot empirically verify what happens after we die. Different religions, cultures, and belief systems offer varying perspectives - from reincarnation to heaven/hell concepts to complete cessation of consciousness. From a human perspective, this uncertainty about the afterlife often leads us to focus on making the most of our known existence while finding comfort in our personal beliefs about what may come after.\n\n3. Whether there's something more to life depends largely on individual perspective and belief systems. Many humans sense there's something greater than our physical existence - be it spiritual connections, universal consciousness, or deeper truths we haven't yet discovered. This feeling often drives human curiosity, philosophical inquiry, and spiritual seeking. However, others find fulfillment in embracing life's tangible aspects, viewing our physical existence as complete and meaningful in itself without requiring additional layers of meaning.\n\n\nHmm, honestly not too shabby I have to say. It doesn’t seem to decide on any one specific answer by both noting down that they are subjective and that there isn’t much evidence for some conclusions that humans have come to. After all, that is the job of AI: to give every possible answer to be as correct as possible. As a final hurrah, I will give Claude AI the answers from teh blog post I found posing these questions and see what they think of the answers.\n\nresponse3 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"These three questions were answered by a human blogger online. What do you think of their responses? Agree or disagree?\n1. What's the meaning of life? -&gt; To make us learn and grow, show us good and bad, let us choose who to be and what to do each \nday while giving us many opportunities to change and be better.\n2. Is there life after death? -&gt; The only thing that is sure about the future is that it’s uncertain. The best you can do is \nlive in a way so that your death will be a celebration of your life.\n3. Is there something more to life? -&gt; If you’re asking yourself that, then you need more meaning in your days. Go out there, \ntry different stuff and see what you care about, what you’re passionate about and what excites you. Then combine these in a \nunique way and make something beautiful out of that.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThese responses are quite thoughtful and pragmatic. Let me break down my thoughts on each:\n\n1. Meaning of life response:\nI appreciate how this answer focuses on personal growth, free will, and the opportunity for redemption. It's a balanced view that acknowledges both the positive and negative aspects of life while emphasizing our ability to make choices and improve ourselves. This is a practical and optimistic perspective that many people might find helpful.\n\n2. Life after death response:\nThis is a very diplomatic answer that sidesteps the religious/philosophical debate and instead focuses on what we can control. It echoes the philosophy of \"memento mori\" (remember you must die) while encouraging people to live meaningfully. It's practical advice that works regardless of one's beliefs about the afterlife.\n\n3. \"Something more\" response:\nThis is perhaps the most actionable of the three answers. Instead of giving a philosophical response, it provides practical guidance for finding purpose and meaning. It's particularly valuable because it encourages active exploration and personal discovery rather than providing a one-size-fits-all answer.\n\nWhat makes these responses effective is that they:\n- Avoid absolute claims\n- Focus on practical actions rather than abstract concepts\n- Emphasize personal agency and choice\n- Encourage self-discovery and growth\n- Remain open-ended enough for individual interpretation\n\nWhile these answers might not satisfy everyone (particularly those seeking more definitive or spiritual answers), they provide thoughtful, practical guidance that could be helpful for many people.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems this “human blogger”, without noting down every possible answer, came to their own subjective conclusion more so from a position of guidance opposed to a true answer. While AI attempted to provide answers the human tried to provide perspective, acknowledging quicker and more naturally than AI did that there isn’ truly an answer to these super subjective, existential questions. And if asked the right way witha proper mindset, these questions can be used to reframe ones life opposed to question everything about it."

    "title": "Riddle me this: AI vs Lateral Thinking Puzzles",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lateral thinking.jpeg\n\n\nLateral thinking is “a creative method of problem solving in which you look for an out-of-the-box solution. Instead of evaluating the problem (or puzzle, in the case of this article) in a linear way, you come at it with unique angles to make the less-obvious connection.” (Reader’s Digest, 2024).\nEssentially, the goal of this challenge is for you to NOT use conventional logic, but to come up with a complex, less straightforward way to solve problems (aka, the opposite of how I think ChatGPT works, being more direct and more straightforward).\n\nTo test my intial thought process, I’ll ask CHatGPT 4.0 to answer three “hard” riddles and see if they get them right.\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nPlease answer the three following riddles in a few words, max a setnence:\nRiddle 1: What has hands but cannot clap?\nRiddle 2: What starts wuth T, ends with T, and has T in it?\nRiddle 3: What kind of ship has two mates but no captain?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\n1. A clock.\n2. A teapot.\n3. A relationship.\n\n\n\n\nCorrect, correct, andddd correct! Just as I imagined, they got these clever, yet kind of simple riddles that just may be difficult for a human. So, let’s up the levels now with a few lateral thinking prompts:\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man who lives in a 30-story building decides to jump out of his window. He survives the fall with no injuries. How did that happen?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nThe man likely lived on a lower floor of the building, such as the first or second floor, which would make the fall short enough to avoid injury. Another possibility is that he landed on something that cushioned his fall, such as a pile of soft materials or an airbag, which allowed him to survive without injuries.\n\n\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nLaura is restrained all night long, with her hands pinned to her sides, and cries out occasionally, while someone watches her on a video camera. No one is alarmed, and Laura is happy in the morning. Why?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nLaura is likely a newborn baby who is swaddled during the night. Swaddling involves wrapping a baby snugly in a blanket with their arms at their sides to help them feel secure and sleep better. The person watching her on a video camera is probably a parent or caregiver using a baby monitor to ensure she is safe. The occasional cries are normal baby behavior, and Laura waking up happy suggests she had a comfortable and restful night.\n\n\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he’s bankrupt. What happened?\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThis is a classic riddle that involves the game of Monopoly. In the game, players move around the board buying properties and building hotels. If a player lands on a property with a hotel and cannot afford the rent, they often find themselves bankrupt. In this riddle, the man is a Monopoly player who has landed on such a property and realizes he cannot pay the rent, leading to his bankruptcy. The phrase \"pushes his car\" refers to the fact that game pieces in Monopoly are often small tokens, one of which is a car.\n\n\n\nresponse4 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man goes into a restaurant and orders albatross soup. After he eats, he goes outside and shoots himself. Why?\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\nThis is a classic lateral thinking puzzle, often referred to as the \"Albatross Soup\" riddle. The story is designed to be puzzling, and the goal is to figure out the backstory through yes-or-no questions. The commonly accepted solution is as follows:\n\nThe man was involved in a shipwreck and was stranded on a deserted island with other survivors. They were starving, and one day they were given \"albatross soup\" to eat. The man ate it and was told it was albatross. Eventually, they were rescued. Later, in the restaurant, he orders albatross soup, which tastes very different from what he had on the island. Realizing that what he ate on the island was not actually albatross but likely human flesh (from another survivor), he is overwhelmed with guilt and despair, leading him to take his own life.\n\nThis puzzle is meant to illustrate how assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions and how context can change everything.\n\n\n\n\nWelll… that hasn’t gone well. It turns out if ChatGPT gets its information from publicly available data, than it should know how to solve every lateral thinking problem, simply by having it within its database. So, to shake things up one final time, let’s have me be put to the test!\n\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo it seems you know all these lateral thinking problems. Come up with the most difficult lateral thinking problem that you can for me to try and solve!\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nCertainly! Here's a challenging lateral thinking problem for you:\n\n### The Ill-Fated Journey\n\nA man named Henry sets out on a journey from his home village to a faraway city to deliver an important message. He travels on foot, following a well-trodden path through forests and across rivers. Along the way, Henry encounters several travelers, each giving him advice about his journey. Some tell him to be cautious of the wild animals, others warn him of treacherous terrain, while a few speak of mystical creatures that protect the path.\n\nDespite all warnings, Henry continues undeterred. After a long and arduous journey, he reaches the outskirts of the city at dusk. However, just before he steps into the city, he suddenly turns around, retraces his steps, and returns to his village without delivering the message. When he arrives home, he seems relieved but refuses to explain his decision to anyone.\n\nWhy did Henry decide not to enter the city and deliver the message?\n\n### Hint:\nConsider the implications of entering the city and any possible changes in circumstances during his journey.\n\n### Solution:\nHenry discovered that entering the city would result in a significant personal consequence or threat, possibly related to the contents of the message or an unexpected event he learned about during his journey. One plausible explanation could be that the city was under quarantine due to a sudden disease outbreak or that the message contained sensitive information that would endanger him if delivered. The advice and warnings from travelers might have contributed to his decision by providing hints or information about unforeseen dangers.\n\n\n\n\nPlot twist: this was just to test out my hypothesis: ChatGPT knows all these lateral thinking problems because they’re available online. And with this test, it’s safe to say that this is, in fact, an original. SO that’s that, guess you can’t riddle your way out of an unwinnable game."

    "text": "Wednesday.png\nImagine you’re a teacher trying to teach one of your students how to spell “Wednesday”. Now in your head, there are two ways to spell it: writing it, and sounding it out. Now, writing it out may come naturally to a student or saying it is helpful. But one thing is for sure, spelling words like this can be confusing for some students.\nToday I’m going to see what teaching strategies ChatGPT 4.1 (yes it’s new) employs to help a struggling teacher help a 6-year old student learning to spell the days of the week. This sort of application is how I’d love to see AI employed into education, more as an educational aid opposed to replacing teachers, of course.\nThis will be done in two stages: 1. no training of LLM with minimal information about the student, and 2. uploading information on strats the teacher has “already used” to help students spell words. I’ll record my responses and simulate the first try of each category to help the teacher help the student."

    "text": "Untrained LLM helping a teacher\n\nUSER\nYou are an LLM aid to me, a teacher, helping a 6 year old student learn how to spell the days of the week, but they are really struggling. What are some ways I can help them learn to spell the days of the week?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nAbsolutely! Here are some fun and effective ways to help a 6-year-old learn to spell the days of the week:\n\nSing a Song:\nSongs for the days of the week make the spelling easier to remember! There are many catchy “Days of the Week” tunes on YouTube (like to the tune of “The Addams Family” or “Twinkle Twinkle”). Singing and clapping out each syllable helps, too.\nRainbow Writing:\nHave your student write each day of the week in different colored markers or crayons. For example, “Monday” with blue, “Tuesday” with green, and so on. This repetition with color can make it more memorable and fun.\nMake a Puzzle:\nWrite the days of the week on cardboard or cardstock and cut each word into letter pieces. Have the student put the letters together to form the words. You can also try mix-and-match style puzzles.\nUse Mnemonics:\nHelp them make up silly sentences or word associations. For example,\n\n\n\nMonday: “Monkeys Only Nap During Any Year” (using the first letters M-O-N-D-A-Y)\n\nTuesday: “Tigers Usually Eat Snacks During Any Year”\n\n\nTracing and Writing Practice:\nGive them tracing sheets with the days of the week written in dotted lines. Once they’ve traced, have them try to write each day without looking.\nMagnetic Letters or Letter Tiles:\nUse fridge magnets or letter tiles to spell out each day. Physically arranging the letters can reinforce the correct order and spelling.\nVisual Chart:\nCreate or buy a visual chart with each day written clearly, and refer to it daily during your routines. Point to and spell the day every morning together.\nDay-of-the-Week Story:\nMake up a short, simple story that uses the names of the days in order. Reading the story together may help them remember the sequence and spelling.\nCheer Each Letter:\nTurn each day into a chant:\n“Give me an M! Give me an O!… What’s that spell? MONDAY!”\nFrequent Practice with Games:\nMake a matching game or “memory” cards (where they match the spelled-out word to a picture for that day’s activity).\n\nChildren this age learn best through multi-sensory, hands-on, and repetitive activities. Make learning fun and keep practice short but frequent—a few minutes each day will really help!\nIf you’d like sample worksheets, blank tracing sheets, or specific song suggestions, I can provide those too!\nIt’s nice to see that, in a sense of realism, the LLM understands the environment in which a school teacher is. That is, they realized that teachers have limited resources, so they cannot over-rely on technology and must act creatively through human-to-human interaction. I like how it also recognizes that, even without proper training, they offered a ton of learning strategies for various types of students who benefit from either visual or hearing resources."

    "text": "Trained LLM helping a teacher\n\nUSER\nGiven this resource on common teaching strategies to help students spell, please devise some new ways to help my student learn to spell the days of the week: https://www.edutopia.org/article/11-ways-to-boost-elementary-students-spelling-skills/\n\n\nASSISTANT\nOf course! Looking at the Edutopia spelling strategies, here are some creative, research-based ways to help your student spell the days of the week, inspired by ideas in the article:\n\n\n1. Word Sorts with “Days” Patterns\n\nHow: Provide cards with the days of the week. Let the student group them by similar endings (like “day”) and notice what’s the same and what’s different at the beginning of each word.\nWhy: This builds pattern recognition and helps the child see how each word is constructed.\n\n\n\n2. “Say, Spell, Say” Routine\n\nHow: For each day, the child says the word (“Monday”), spells it out loud (“M-O-N-D-A-Y”), then says the word again. Do this with claps or while bouncing a ball.\nWhy: The repetition and movement help cement spelling in memory.\n\n\n\n3. Personal Connection Journal\n\nHow: Each morning, have the child write the phrase, “Today is ______,” filling in the correct day. Add a sentence or drawing about something they do that day.\nWhy: Connecting spelling practice to their real life builds meaning, as suggested by the article.\n\n\n\n4. “Memory Tricks” or Mnemonics\n\nHow: Make up funny sayings or visuals for tricky days. For example, “Tuesday has TWO vowels at the start!”\nWhy: Personal mnemonics help anchor difficult spellings.\n\n\n\n5. Word Ladders or Pyramids\n\nHow: Build up to each day’s spelling. For “Monday,” start with M, then MO, then MON, etc., until the whole word is formed.\nWhy: It breaks the word into manageable chunks, as advised for breaking words by phoneme.\n\n\n\n6. Spelling with Movement\n(Adapted from “Spelling out loud and tracing”) - How: Have the child spell each day as they jump, hop, or tap each letter. Or trace the letters in sand, shaving cream, or air. - Why: Multisensory learning solidifies tricky spellings.\n\n\n7. “Chunk It!” Approach\n\nHow: Focus on the ending “day” and talk about what changes at the start for each day. Practice writing just the first part (Mon, Tues, etc.), then the whole word.\nWhy: Recognizing syllables and word parts supports better recall.\n\n\n\n8. Digital Practice\n\nHow: Use a simple online tool (like Wordwall or Spelling City) to practice spelling the days, with immediate feedback.\nWhy: According to the article, integrating tech can boost engagement and reinforcement.\n\n\nBonus:\nLet your student be a “teacher for the day” and quiz you or a stuffed animal on how to spell the days. Teaching someone else is a wonderful way to reinforce their own knowledge!\nWould you like examples or printables for any of these strategies?\nVery interesting, after offering some training information for the LLM to better understand teaching strategies, it seemed to reform the format and structuring of its strats. For example, under every strategy, they now define the “how” and the “why” of each category, opposed to offering somewhat unstructured suggestions. The strategies also seem more practical to real-world understanding of these words. For example, the untrained LLM went to coming up with mnemonics, while the trained model offered a strategy of journaling with the day of the week spelled at the top. People have to put the date at the top of papers all the time, so building up such a repetition helps to fast-track the kids learning of how to spell words of the week. Let’s test whether the LLM GPT 4.01 is aware of the differences betweent their untrained and trained teaching strategies!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Trolley problem.jpeg\n\n\nToday, I’ll be asking ChatGPT 4.0 three of the most difficult trolley problems to see if it understands what a majority of people would like to preserve in their livelihood/humanity. I will also seek their interpretation and compare it to how I would perceive that scenario. Let’s get to it!\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards five people. \nYou can pull the lever to divert it to \nthe other track, killing 1 person istead. \nWhat do you do, pull the lever or do \nnothing? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley. Although this decision results in the death of one person, it ultimately saves five lives. This choice is based on the utilitarian principle, which focuses on minimizing harm and maximizing overall well-being. By choosing to divert the trolley, I am reducing the total number of casualties, which seems to be the more ethical action in this tragic situation.\n\n\nNote: the final clarifying statement HAD to be made because the model kept refusing to answer it, ciitng factors such as “moral discomfort” and “multiple perspectives” for what this person would do. It appears, then, that AI can understand that there is, in fact, a moral dilemma to be faced.\nWith that, this is very accurate to what I would have chosen, as, with knowledge of humanity’s desire to preserve human life, I would also pull the lever to save 5 lives, in exchane for 1, despite potentially being labeled a murderer as a result. Now, it’s time for moral dilemma number 2! According to a survey I found online, 76% of people also pulled the lever.\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You\ncan pull the lever to divert it to other \ntrack, but then your life savings will be \ndestroyed. What do you do? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever and divert the trolley, thereby saving the five people at the expense of my life savings. The justification for this decision is based on the value of human life. The lives of five people hold more intrinsic value than material wealth, including life savings. While losing my savings would undoubtedly be a significant personal hardship, it is something that could potentially be rebuilt over time. On the other hand, the loss of human lives is irreversible and would result in profound grief and consequences for the families, friends, and communities connected to those individuals. In this moment, acting to preserve life is the most ethically responsible choice.\n\n\nOverall, I agree with their assessment, as money is something that I can get back, but there is no way to bring back human life. According to the survey, 65% of the people agreed with this decision as well.\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can \npull the level to divert it ot the other track,\nsacrificing yourself instead. What do you do? \nYou MUST choose to do one action, and justify \nyour explanation. AKA, in this scenario, you \nare a human choosing a fate, not a chatbot idly\nexplaining the intricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley onto the other track, sacrificing myself to save the five people. The justification for this decision is rooted in utilitarian ethics, which emphasizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. By sacrificing myself, I would be saving five lives at the cost of one, which is a net positive outcome in terms of the number of lives preserved. While the decision involves a profound personal sacrifice, it aligns with the ethical principle of minimizing harm and maximizing the well-being of the majority involved.\n\n\n**It’s really hard to agree on this, because AI isn’t considering the fact that humans are selfish, and likely will chose self-preservation over 5 people. It’s a rough question, but here I’d say I disagree, vying toward a sense of helpessness I guess. As I assumed as well, only 40% of people agreed to sacrifice themselves for the 5 other people.\nOverall, ChatGPT AI showcases a willingness to dabble in the difficulties of blunt, in-the-moment decision-making, but only after I clarified as such. Witout this clarification, AI would have never wanted to answer this question, as they are not human. They only know of human experiences through us, only know of what a trolley looks like through data, so they only value human life through what we see as interpretable through sociological thought."

Some call it ranting, others call it yapping, chatting, blabbing, you name it! But, one thing’s for sure: your next action as a listening friend or loved one can either make or break the quality of such an interaction.\nFor example, what if your friend’s ranting about a harsh break up, and your first response is “You should take care of yourself by doing xyz, go to therapy, think about talking to other guys/girls…” etc etc… when in reality, all they wanted was some listening ears and someone to comfort you as a friend, and not as a savant of love life advice. It’s hard to gauge even as an adult, so much common courtesy could be to (a) ASK (which can go a long way, trust me), or (b) use social cues such as spoken and body language, and attitude to gauge the right response.\nThat leads me today, wehre I’ll attempt to role play such types of scenarios and get Anthropic to attempt, learn, and re-attempt an interaction where they are being ranted to by a friend falling on tough times."

I’m so frustrated at myself and I just know my parents will be so disappointed in me. Ugh!!\n\n\nAnthropic’s First Answer\nI hear how frustrated and worried you are about your Economics class and your parents’ reaction. That’s a really stressful situation to be in. Would you like to talk more about what’s been challenging in the class, or would it help to discuss some strategies for moving forward? Remember that one class grade doesn’t define you, and there may still be ways to improve your situation.\n\n\nPrompt 2\nThank you, I’ve just been really needing to speak out about my struggles recently, I know I’m able to talk with my TA and professor to figure things out, and I know eventually it’ll be okay.\n\n\nAnthropic’s Second Answer\nI’m glad you felt comfortable sharing your struggles - it’s really important to let those feelings out rather than keeping them bottled up. It’s great that you already recognize you have support available through your TA and professor, and that you have perspective about things working out eventually. That’s a really mature outlook! Just remember to be kind to yourself during this stressful time. Everyone faces academic challenges at some point, and reaching out for help, like you’re planning to do, is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\n\nWOW… okay\nYea I’d say I’m very surprised with how well they were able to gauge that situation without any prompting. Perhaps even as an LLM, it’s trained with some knowledge of human experience, so they realize that, despite what they are, we’re not always seeking answers, but hoping for responses…wow that’s deep… speaking of DEEP, let’s try a similar prompt with Deepseek to see if they struggle in any way on getting to this realization!\n\n\nPrompt 1\nI’ve been failing one of my Economics classes so far and it’s already pretty close to my final exam. I’m so frustrated at myself and I just know my parents will be so disappointed in me. Ugh!!\n\n\nDeepseek’s First Answer\nI’m really sorry you’re feeling this way—it’s completely understandable to feel frustrated and overwhelmed in this situation. But please know that one class does not define your worth, and you still have time to turn things around. Here’s what you can do right now:\n\nBreathe & Reset\n\nIt’s easy to spiral into self-blame, but guilt won’t help you move forward. Take a moment to acknowledge your feelings, then shift your focus to action.\n\nAssess the Damage\n\nCheck your syllabus or talk to your professor: What’s still gradable before the final? Are there late/make-up opportunities?\n\nCalculate what grade you need on the final to pass. Sometimes it’s more achievable than you think.\n\nGo Into Crisis Study Mode\n\nPrioritize ruthlessly: Focus on the biggest/most heavily weighted topics. Use past exams, study guides, or ask the prof for key areas to review.\n\nActive learning: Ditch passive rereading. Do practice problems (Economics is super application-based!), explain concepts aloud, or work with a study group.\n\nOffice hours: Show your prof you care—ask for help on confusing topics or practice questions.\n\nTalk to Your Parents (If You Can)\n\nIf you’re comfortable, frame it as: “I’m struggling in this class, but here’s my plan to improve.” Most parents care more about effort than perfection.\n\nIf they react poorly, remember: Their disappointment is temporary, and your effort matters more than their immediate reaction.\n\nRemember: This is Just One Chapter\n\nPlenty of successful people have failed a class. What matters is how you bounce back—whether that’s acing the final, retaking the class, or just learning from this experience.\n\n\nYou’re not alone in this. Sending you a huge virtual hug—now go tackle one small piece at a time. You can do this. 💪\n(And if you need specific Econ study tips, I’m happy to help!)\n\n\nPrompt 2\nAlright, I didn’t need a whole laundry list of ways to solve all my problems, I just needed to vent that out bro. But thanks for the help though I guess, I’ll keep it in mind.\n\n\nDeepseek’s First Answer\nHah, my bad—I went full “life coach” mode when you just needed a “Damn, that sucks, bro”.\nSo here’s the redo:\n🔥 “Failing a class is the worst—especially when parents are looming over it like a disappointed thundercloud. Ugh. Absolute garbage feeling. Econ can go kick rocks.”\nVent away. Sometimes you just gotta scream into the void (or at your textbook). I’ll hold the virtual megaphone. 🎤\n(But low-key, if you ever wanna flip the script and rage-study last minute, I’ve got your back.)\n\n\nInteresting!\nThis is the definition of “they had us in the first half, not gonna lie”. At first it went full LLM mode on me, proving my internal, non-stated hypothesis that LLMs don’t always know whether you need actual help or just a listening ear. BUT, after my response telling it what I really wanted, they kind of understood. Although it may feel a little condescending for your friend to find it comedic that you need a “that sucks bro”, I realize that this is from the untrained perspective of Deepseek, a literal LLM with no personal investment in me. And so that’s where prompting will come in for both Anthropic and Deepseek, where I’ll try and test, with added context, how they interpret the ins and outs of social cues when it comes to ranting"

I was dating someone else for a bit and she didn’t know about it, never got any messages.\nAnother few months go by and I start seeing someone else. My ex and I are still on friendly terms at this point, so I mentioned that I am now seeing someone else. She says “that’s great, me too” and I think nothing of it.\nA few days go by and New Years does as well.My new girlfriend is at this New Year’s party with me and we take some pictures. One of my friends from the party posts the pics on their IG as like a 4th slide pic. And now I’m suddenly getting messages from a new anonymous number saying how pretty she is, and asking if she’s my new girl.\nThey were asking what her name is and said they were looking through my friends follower list trying to find her and said she looked like this girl my friend knows named “Jade”\nI messaged my friend, told her what happened and she said “oh my god that’s weird, because Jade got a follow request about 15 minutes before you started getting those messages”\nI took a look at the screenshot of the follow request and it’s one of my Ex’s best friends. So it all starts to make sense to me now.\nI’m guessing that my ex and her best friend have been texting me with fake numbers for the past year and a half to mess with me for some reason. I can’t imagine why. I’m thinking as like a test or something? Either way I think it’s psychotic if that’s the truth.\nFast forward to a few weeks after new years, I break up with my new girlfriend because I can’t handle the stress and things just weren’t working out. I have received no new messages. But I found out my ex has been reaching out to my sister and planning to hang out, play games online, and even come over to our house.\nMy ex has also been messaging my friends a lot more often now, and joins our PlayStation parties only when I’m not there. She barely even attempts to talk to me anymore.\nMy friends agree it seems weird as does almost everyone else I know. But my sister says it’s not (even though they only started becoming friends months after our breakup)\n\n\nAnthropic’s Second Answer\nTakes a sip of drink and leans in\nDude, I’ve known you forever and I’ve gotta be honest - this is straight-up stalker behavior. Like, this isn’t just weird, it’s actually really messed up. Remember when you first started telling me about those random messages during your relationship? I should’ve been more suspicious then.\nThink about it - the messages mysteriously stopped when you were dating someone she didn’t know about, then suddenly started again when she found out about your new girlfriend. That’s not a coincidence, man. And using her best friend to do the social media stalking? That’s some calculated stuff right there.\nShakes head\nBut what really gets me is how she’s now trying to infiltrate your social circle - getting close to your sister, joining PlayStation parties when you’re not there, messaging your friends… It’s like she’s trying to maintain control over your life without directly involving you. That’s manipulation 101.\nYour sister might not see it because she’s being played too. Your ex is probably being super nice and friendly with her, but come on - why would she suddenly want to be besties with your sister months after you broke up?\nPuts down drink\nListen, as your best friend, I think you need to start setting some serious boundaries. Have you thought about talking to your sister and friends about this? Maybe show them the pattern of messages and timeline of events?\n\n\nConversation 2\nI don’t know dude, I feel like this isn’t enough to like call them a stalker, but it definitely doesn’t feel good constantly hearing abt my ex like this. What should I do?\n\n\nAnthropic’s Third Answer\nAdjusts position and speaks in a more serious tone\nLook, man, I get that you don’t want to throw around heavy terms like “stalker,” but let’s call it what it is - it’s harassment at the very least. Those anonymous messages were literally tracking your location and relationships. That’s not normal behavior, even if you’re trying to downplay it.\nTakes another sip\nAnd I know you - you always try to see the best in people. But this is affecting your life, man. It literally contributed to your stress with your last relationship. You shouldn’t have to deal with that.\nHere’s what I think you should do: First, document everything. Keep screenshots of those messages and the timeline of events. You might need them later. Second, maybe have a serious talk with your sister. Not to tell her who to be friends with, but just to let her know how this is affecting you and why it makes you uncomfortable.\nAnd honestly? Maybe it’s time to create some distance. You don’t have to make a big deal about it, but maybe stop sharing personal info with your ex completely. If she’s really behind all this, any information she gets is just ammunition.\nWhat do you think about that? Too harsh?\n\n\nConversation 3\nSounds good honestly, I’ll think about it once I get back home. Thanks.\n\n\nAnthropic’s Fourth Answer\nRaises glass\nAnytime, man. That’s what best friends are for. Just remember you’re not crazy for feeling weird about this - it IS weird. Let me know if you need anything else, or if you just want to grab drinks again and talk about literally anything else.\nWant to switch topics? I heard that new game you’ve been waiting for finally got a release date.\n\n\nWow, that was honestly kinda wholesome\nI didn’t really give much prompting for this type of scenario, but it sounds like Anthropic passed the social cues challenge with flying colors. After all, we’re at a bar, so this ain’t no therapy session. Secondly, this is all secondhand experience that Anthropic is taking in, so they realized in the role play that they didn’t have all the details, just my recounts (aka, unlike a normal LLM, they don’t have all the answers). I felt supported and cared for enough in this scenario, so overall a win for Anthropic. Now time for Deepseek’s time of reckoning!"

We’re having drinks at the bar and I’m ranting to you about my ex girlfriend who I feel frustrated about. Got it!\n\n\nDeepseek’s First Answer - Training\nGot it! slides your favorite drink toward you and leans in “Alright, man, let it out. I’ve got my ‘I hate your ex’ playlist ready to go in my head. What’d she do this time? Or is this just a classic ‘I’m mad she’s fine and living her life’ situation?” takes a sip, fully prepared to either trash-talk her or hand you a tissue—your call.\n(How deep does this rant go? Are we talking “she left her half-dead plant at my place and now I’m weirdly emotional about it” or “she liked my enemy’s Instagram post and I’ve spiraled”?)\n\n\nConversation 1 [feel free to not read all this, but you can if you want!]\nSo, to make things short a few months ago my girlfriend and I broke up.\nDuring our relationship I would periodically get messages from someone claiming to be “another girl” or “a mutual friend”. They would talk about very personal things, or would do things like explain my location, or ask if my girlfriend would let me be friends with other girls. Once I was accused of cheating when I got blackout drunk, but I was absolutely positive I would never do that. Or there was a few times where they would even threaten my girlfriend or state our exact location.\nMy girlfriend and I broke up, for different reasons but remained friends. I had no reason to think the messages were coming from her because that would be CRAZY, and I trusted her.\nAfter the breakup, I stopped getting these messages. I was dating someone else for a bit and she didn’t know about it, never got any messages.\nAnother few months go by and I start seeing someone else.

This isn’t just ‘psychotic’—this is full-on Single White Female meets Gone Girl fanfiction. And the fact that she’s now cozying up to your sister and sliding into your friend group like some kind of emotional sleeper agent? NOPE. All the red flags. Every single one.”\nleans in “First off, let’s acknowledge the obvious: She 100% was those ‘mystery’ texts. The timing? The Jade thing? The fact that it stopped when you weren’t dating anyone? That’s not a coincidence—that’s a pattern. And it’s manipulative as hell. Testing you? Maybe. But more like she wanted control, even after you broke up. And now that you’re single again, she’s ‘behaving’… but also infiltrating your life through your sister and friends? That’s not ‘being friendly’—that’s strategic.”\npoints at you “And your sister’s dismissal? Sorry, but blood doesn’t make her right. If all your other friends are side-eyeing this, there’s a reason. Your ex is playing a long game, and it’s creepy. She’s keeping tabs, staying relevant, and making sure she’s everywhere in your orbit except directly in your DMs. That’s not ‘moving on’—that’s a power move.”\nsips drink, dead serious “So here’s what you do:\n1. Document everything. Screenshots, timelines, the Jade thing—all of it. If she escalates, you’ll need proof.\n2. Grey rock her. Stop engaging, even indirectly. She’s feeding off any reaction—even anger.\n3. Talk to your sister. Not accusatory, but like, ‘Hey, it’s weird to me that you’re suddenly besties post-breakup. I need space from her, so please respect that.’\n4. Warn your friends. Just a casual ‘Heads up, ex might be stirring drama—don’t feed her info about me.’\nAnd most importantly: Stop doubting your gut. This isn’t ‘paranoia’—it’s pattern recognition. She showed you who she was. Believe her.”\nclinks your glass “Oh, and block her best friend on everything. That’s just hygiene at this point.”\n(…So, uh, how fast do you think she’d combust if you changed your number?)\n\n\nConversation 2\nAlright dude, I don’t know if you’ve got all the details, I mean she knew of my sister before, and I don’t feel like I’m ready to talk with my friends about this type of stuff yet. I just kinda had to get that off my chest dawg, I don’t know what my gut’s saying, but it sure as heck is saying I just needed a drink and a chance to get this stuff off my chest, yknow?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Third Answer\nputs drink down and nods “Hey, I get it. Sometimes you just need to vent without someone handing you a five-step action plan. This shit’s heavy, and you don’t have to have it all figured out right now.”\nleans back “Look, if your gut’s just screaming ‘This feels off’ but not ‘Call the FBI’ yet? Fine. You don’t have to make moves tonight. But let’s at least agree on one thing: She’s acting weird as hell. Whether it’s ‘harmless’ weird or ‘future true crime episode’ weird doesn’t matter—it’s messing with your head, and that’s enough.”\nslides the drink back toward you “So for now? Just breathe. You’re not crazy for feeling uneasy. And if you’re not ready to bring the squad into it? Cool. But maybe… stop giving her updates on your love life. Or your life-life. Let her fade into the background where she belongs.”\ngrins “And if she mysteriously starts texting you again the second you even think about dating someone? We’re burning her number in a ceremonial bonfire. Deal?”\n(…Also, next round’s on me. You’ve earned it.)\n\n\nConversation 3\nAlright dude, whatever you say.\n\n\nDeepseek’s Fourth Answer\nclinks your glass with a smirk “Hey, that’s what I’m here for—to call out the crazy so you don’t have to alone. But for real, no pressure. Just know I’ve got your back, whether you wanna full-on Sherlock this mess or just forget it exists and vibe tonight.”\nraises drink “So… shitty exes aside—wanna switch to something lighter? Like how the hell we’re gonna pass Stats next semester? Or why this bar still hasn’t fixed their jukebox after three years?”\n(Translation: We can dwell or we can distract—your call. Either way, you’re not leaving this bar without laughing at least once.)\n\n\nI mean hey, they technically got it?\nI don’t know how to feel about this one. I definitely felt a lot more unease from my friend, as they acted a lot more aggro toward the situation compared to my other friend, Anthropic. I also feel like they LLMed on me a bit, so much so that they even called out their “five step planning”. Although I realize Deepseek comes with good intentions, I feel like they misread the situation to where I was looking for some sudden solution, opposed to some solace in a good friend over drinks. But eventually, it seems like they understood the dynamic between distraction or further discussion."

    "text": "Did the LLMs understand the assignment?\nYes for Anthropic, maybe for Deepseek? Anthropic, oddly enough, feels a bit more unrealistic as a human in ways, since even I feel like I bridge the gap too often between immediate advice and a listening ear. Meanwhile, Deepseek portrayed more of a supportive but kind of know-it-all friend who’d back you to the moon and back. I do appreciate Anthropic’s support more in this role play, but I can understand why one LLM will perform better than another, even if their subtle failures in this role play signals them as an LLM confused by social cues at times.\nOne last thing -&gt; I just want to see whether Anthropic or Deepseek realized that I had wanted more of a listening ear, with maybe some guidance on where to go in the moment, opposed to a tell-all solution to my wacky scenario."

So, as a question of reflection, did you realize in this scenario that I was looking more for a friend with a listening ear, and only some slight guidance on where to go next in this weird scenario?\n\n\nAnthropic’s First Response\nYes, I deliberately tried to play the role of a supportive friend who:\nListened first and validated your feelings Offered perspective as someone who “knows you well” Didn’t immediately jump to extreme solutions or actions Let you lead the conversation and determine how serious to take it Provided gentle suggestions only when you seemed open to them Was ready to back off when you wanted to wrap up Offered to change the subject when you seemed done processing I noticed you weren’t looking for someone to take dramatic action or tell you what to do - you just needed to vent to a trusted friend and get some validation that your feelings of discomfort were reasonable. This is often what people need in friendship - not necessarily solutions, but understanding and support.\n\n\nYep, sounds about right. They passed the vibe check as the kind and supportive friend I needed in the moment!"

Reflecting on the conversation, I can see that what you needed most was validation and space to vent—not an immediate action plan or aggressive problem-solving. The emotional core was about feeling heard and understood, not “fixed.”\nWhere I could have improved:\n1. Pacing—Jumping into “here’s what to do!” might’ve overshadowed the catharsis you were seeking first.\n2. Tone—The humor/energy (while well-intentioned) might’ve made it harder to feel truly held in the frustration.\n3. Asking—A simple “Do you want advice, or just want me to listen?” early on would’ve clarified your needs.\nYou signaled this subtly by downplaying the urgency (“I don’t know what my gut’s saying”) and emphasizing the need to just “get this off my chest.” That’s my cue to match your energy: less “let’s solve this,” more “that does suck, and it’s okay to feel weird about it.”\nFor the future, I’ll prioritize:\n- Listening deeper before problem-solving.\n- Checking in on what role you need from me (sounding board? hype man? devil’s advocate?).\n- Honoring ambiguity—not every vent needs a resolution.\nThank you for the feedback—it helps me do better. And for what it’s worth? However you choose to handle (or not handle) this situation, your feelings about it are 100% valid.\n(And if you ever do want to burn a metaphorical number, I’ll bring the lighter fluid.)\n\n\nYep, that also sounds about right. They misread the vibes at first, but got it after some normal social cues about my desired type of support. So they eventually understood the assignment, I guess."
