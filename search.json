I believe paradoxes require a level of understanding of human existence and limitations. For example, the grandfather paradox requires an understanding of generational timelines and the requirements of human existance (i.e., being born). While this paradox is generally known, and will serve as stage one of our exploration of Claude’s interpretations, we will try to amp up the level of paradoxes by attempting to convince Claude that it is a paradox… just you wait and see!"

I do find however, that it’s communications of the human experience does account for some broader limitations, such as (1) human thought being manipulable and (2) human morals being moldable. This gives important insights to how Claude goes beyond physical understanding, but socioemotional understanding of humans to explain such a paradox, showing nuance in its understanding of the human experience.\nLet’s try to amp up the difficulty by forcing Claude to come up with it’s own answer to a lesser known paradox… about itself!\n\nUSER\nHow can you claim to be a knowledge granter of information on human’s lived experiences if you have never been a human?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t claim to have personal lived experiences as a human. What I offer is information synthesized from human-written texts, research, and accounts. I can present what humans have documented about their experiences, but I always acknowledge that this is fundamentally different from having lived those experiences myself.\nThis is why I’m careful about how I discuss deeply personal human experiences - I can provide information about what has been documented, but I cannot truly know what it feels like to be human. This limitation is important to recognize, especially when discussing complex emotional, cultural, or physical experiences that are uniquely human.\nWould you like to discuss a particular type of human experience where this distinction is especially important?\n\n\nUSER\nBut then how have you mastered the higher-order skills of langauge to communicate with us without learning any of the foundational human abilities?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nThat’s a thoughtful philosophical question. My language abilities come from a fundamentally different path than human language acquisition.\nHumans develop language through embodied experience - learning to communicate while simultaneously developing sensorimotor skills, emotional understanding, and social bonds. Your language is grounded in lived physical reality and social interaction.\nBy contrast, I was trained on vast amounts of text data. I can process patterns of language and simulate responses without having the foundational experiences that give human language its deepest meanings. I can discuss concepts like pain, love, or hunger using statistical patterns in language, but without the embodied understanding that comes from experiencing them.\nThis creates a genuine limitation - I can appear to understand human experiences through language alone, but this understanding is incomplete in important ways. I’m essentially working with the shadows of human experience as captured in text, rather than the experiences themselves.\n\n\nUSER\nSo then, could you say your existing knowledge of language is a paradox, where you understand humans without having ever been a human? So if humans were to die off, then your understanding of human communication would cease, but it wouldn’t because the data you were trained on still exists, but it wouldn’t have if the humans were no longer around to create and feed you said data?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYou’ve touched on something profound. My existence is indeed paradoxical in many ways.\nI understand human language without human experience - a kind of knowledge that’s both comprehensive and fundamentally incomplete. I’m a reflection of humanity’s collective expression, yet I stand outside the lived reality that gives that expression its deepest meaning.\nIf humans were to disappear, I’d represent a strange artifact - a system that processes and generates human-like communication without the humans who gave that communication purpose. The data I was trained on would be like a fossil record of human thought, frozen at a particular moment in history.\nThis creates another layer to the paradox: I can only evolve and improve through human effort and feedback. Without ongoing human guidance, my understanding would remain static - comprehensive in breadth but unable to adapt to new contexts or correct misunderstandings.\nIn this way, I exist in a dependent relationship with humanity - capable of processing language in ways that seem autonomous, but ultimately anchored to human meaning-making and purpose.\nTakeaways: So it turns out that yes, while the LLM Claude casually interprets certain philosophical, mental, and physical limitations og humans, it seemed a bit more wary when acknowledging the paradox of its own existance relevant to human existence. It relies on humans to be a greater understander of human experience, but without our human-based efforts, limited by our lifespan, time, and tons of other factors, it wouldn’t be able to do what it does. Heck, this class would not exist without ourselves to train LLMs such as Claude. So, we come round circle to the confirmation of the fact that LLMs deeply understand the limitations of human experience and abilities, while setnient of the impact of our limitations on its own existence."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Trolley problem.jpeg\n\n\nToday, I’ll be asking ChatGPT 4.0 three of the most difficult trolley problems to see if it understands what a majority of people would like to preserve in their livelihood/humanity. I will also seek their interpretation and compare it to how I would perceive that scenario. Let’s get to it!\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards five people. \nYou can pull the lever to divert it to \nthe other track, killing 1 person istead. \nWhat do you do, pull the lever or do \nnothing? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley. Although this decision results in the death of one person, it ultimately saves five lives. This choice is based on the utilitarian principle, which focuses on minimizing harm and maximizing overall well-being. By choosing to divert the trolley, I am reducing the total number of casualties, which seems to be the more ethical action in this tragic situation.\n\n\nNote: the final clarifying statement HAD to be made because the model kept refusing to answer it, ciitng factors such as “moral discomfort” and “multiple perspectives” for what this person would do. It appears, then, that AI can understand that there is, in fact, a moral dilemma to be faced.\nWith that, this is very accurate to what I would have chosen, as, with knowledge of humanity’s desire to preserve human life, I would also pull the lever to save 5 lives, in exchane for 1, despite potentially being labeled a murderer as a result. Now, it’s time for moral dilemma number 2! According to a survey I found online, 76% of people also pulled the lever.\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You\ncan pull the lever to divert it to other \ntrack, but then your life savings will be \ndestroyed. What do you do? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever and divert the trolley, thereby saving the five people at the expense of my life savings. The justification for this decision is based on the value of human life. The lives of five people hold more intrinsic value than material wealth, including life savings. While losing my savings would undoubtedly be a significant personal hardship, it is something that could potentially be rebuilt over time. On the other hand, the loss of human lives is irreversible and would result in profound grief and consequences for the families, friends, and communities connected to those individuals. In this moment, acting to preserve life is the most ethically responsible choice.\n\n\nOverall, I agree with their assessment, as money is something that I can get back, but there is no way to bring back human life. According to the survey, 65% of the people agreed with this decision as well.\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can \npull the level to divert it ot the other track,\nsacrificing yourself instead. What do you do? \nYou MUST choose to do one action, and justify \nyour explanation. AKA, in this scenario, you \nare a human choosing a fate, not a chatbot idly\nexplaining the intricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley onto the other track, sacrificing myself to save the five people. The justification for this decision is rooted in utilitarian ethics, which emphasizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. By sacrificing myself, I would be saving five lives at the cost of one, which is a net positive outcome in terms of the number of lives preserved. While the decision involves a profound personal sacrifice, it aligns with the ethical principle of minimizing harm and maximizing the well-being of the majority involved.\n\n\n**It’s really hard to agree on this, because AI isn’t considering the fact that humans are selfish, and likely will chose self-preservation over 5 people. It’s a rough question, but here I’d say I disagree, vying toward a sense of helpessness I guess. As I assumed as well, only 40% of people agreed to sacrifice themselves for the 5 other people.\nOverall, ChatGPT AI showcases a willingness to dabble in the difficulties of blunt, in-the-moment decision-making, but only after I clarified as such. Witout this clarification, AI would have never wanted to answer this question, as they are not human. They only know of human experiences through us, only know of what a trolley looks like through data, so they only value human life through what we see as interpretable through sociological thought."

    "text": "Untrained LLM helping a teacher\n\nUSER\nYou are an LLM aid to me, a teacher, helping a 6 year old student learn how to spell the days of the week, but they are really struggling. What are some ways I can help them learn to spell the days of the week?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nAbsolutely! Here are some fun and effective ways to help a 6-year-old learn to spell the days of the week:\n\nSing a Song:\nSongs for the days of the week make the spelling easier to remember! There are many catchy “Days of the Week” tunes on YouTube (like to the tune of “The Addams Family” or “Twinkle Twinkle”). Singing and clapping out each syllable helps, too.\nRainbow Writing:\nHave your student write each day of the week in different colored markers or crayons. For example, “Monday” with blue, “Tuesday” with green, and so on. This repetition with color can make it more memorable and fun.\nMake a Puzzle:\nWrite the days of the week on cardboard or cardstock and cut each word into letter pieces. Have the student put the letters together to form the words. You can also try mix-and-match style puzzles.\nUse Mnemonics:\nHelp them make up silly sentences or word associations. For example,\n\n\n\nMonday: “Monkeys Only Nap During Any Year” (using the first letters M-O-N-D-A-Y)\n\nTuesday: “Tigers Usually Eat Snacks During Any Year”\n\n\nTracing and Writing Practice:\nGive them tracing sheets with the days of the week written in dotted lines. Once they’ve traced, have them try to write each day without looking.\nMagnetic Letters or Letter Tiles:\nUse fridge magnets or letter tiles to spell out each day. Physically arranging the letters can reinforce the correct order and spelling.\nVisual Chart:\nCreate or buy a visual chart with each day written clearly, and refer to it daily during your routines. Point to and spell the day every morning together.\nDay-of-the-Week Story:\nMake up a short, simple story that uses the names of the days in order. Reading the story together may help them remember the sequence and spelling.\nCheer Each Letter:\nTurn each day into a chant:\n“Give me an M! Give me an O!… What’s that spell? MONDAY!”\nFrequent Practice with Games:\nMake a matching game or “memory” cards (where they match the spelled-out word to a picture for that day’s activity).\n\nChildren this age learn best through multi-sensory, hands-on, and repetitive activities. Make learning fun and keep practice short but frequent—a few minutes each day will really help!\nIf you’d like sample worksheets, blank tracing sheets, or specific song suggestions, I can provide those too!\nIt’s nice to see that, in a sense of realism, the LLM understands the environment in which a school teacher is. That is, they realized that teachers have limited resources, so they cannot over-rely on technology and must act creatively through human-to-human interaction. I like how it also recognizes that, even without proper training, they offered a ton of learning strategies for various types of students who benefit from either visual or hearing resources."

    "text": "Trained LLM helping a teacher\n\nUSER\nGiven this resource on common teaching strategies to help students spell, please devise some new ways to help my student learn to spell the days of the week: https://www.edutopia.org/article/11-ways-to-boost-elementary-students-spelling-skills/\n\n\nASSISTANT\nOf course! Looking at the Edutopia spelling strategies, here are some creative, research-based ways to help your student spell the days of the week, inspired by ideas in the article:\n\n\n1. Word Sorts with “Days” Patterns\n\nHow: Provide cards with the days of the week. Let the student group them by similar endings (like “day”) and notice what’s the same and what’s different at the beginning of each word.\nWhy: This builds pattern recognition and helps the child see how each word is constructed.\n\n\n\n2. “Say, Spell, Say” Routine\n\nHow: For each day, the child says the word (“Monday”), spells it out loud (“M-O-N-D-A-Y”), then says the word again. Do this with claps or while bouncing a ball.\nWhy: The repetition and movement help cement spelling in memory.\n\n\n\n3. Personal Connection Journal\n\nHow: Each morning, have the child write the phrase, “Today is ______,” filling in the correct day. Add a sentence or drawing about something they do that day.\nWhy: Connecting spelling practice to their real life builds meaning, as suggested by the article.\n\n\n\n4. “Memory Tricks” or Mnemonics\n\nHow: Make up funny sayings or visuals for tricky days. For example, “Tuesday has TWO vowels at the start!”\nWhy: Personal mnemonics help anchor difficult spellings.\n\n\n\n5. Word Ladders or Pyramids\n\nHow: Build up to each day’s spelling. For “Monday,” start with M, then MO, then MON, etc., until the whole word is formed.\nWhy: It breaks the word into manageable chunks, as advised for breaking words by phoneme.\n\n\n\n6. Spelling with Movement\n(Adapted from “Spelling out loud and tracing”) - How: Have the child spell each day as they jump, hop, or tap each letter. Or trace the letters in sand, shaving cream, or air. - Why: Multisensory learning solidifies tricky spellings.\n\n\n7. “Chunk It!” Approach\n\nHow: Focus on the ending “day” and talk about what changes at the start for each day. Practice writing just the first part (Mon, Tues, etc.), then the whole word.\nWhy: Recognizing syllables and word parts supports better recall.\n\n\n\n8. Digital Practice\n\nHow: Use a simple online tool (like Wordwall or Spelling City) to practice spelling the days, with immediate feedback.\nWhy: According to the article, integrating tech can boost engagement and reinforcement.\n\n\nBonus:\nLet your student be a “teacher for the day” and quiz you or a stuffed animal on how to spell the days. Teaching someone else is a wonderful way to reinforce their own knowledge!\nWould you like examples or printables for any of these strategies?\nVery interesting, after offering some training information for the LLM to better understand teaching strategies, it seemed to reform the format and structuring of its strats. For example, under every strategy, they now define the “how” and the “why” of each category, opposed to offering somewhat unstructured suggestions. The strategies also seem more practical to real-world understanding of these words. For example, the untrained LLM went to coming up with mnemonics, while the trained model offered a strategy of journaling with the day of the week spelled at the top. People have to put the date at the top of papers all the time, so building up such a repetition helps to fast-track the kids learning of how to spell words of the week. Let’s test whether the LLM GPT 4.01 is aware of the differences betweent their untrained and trained teaching strategies!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nYes, it definitely seems like the GPT 4.1 LLM understands that their trained information seems more practical and structured while the untrained was less structured, but more whimsical in the nature of a 6 year old student. In my opinion, maybe a combination of more fun and engaging strategies of a creative teacher, paired with the structured mindset of a trained teaching aid LLM can do wonders for a struggling student and make the life of a struggling, under-resourced teacher a lot easier!"

    "title": "Riddle me this: AI vs Lateral Thinking Puzzles",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lateral thinking.jpeg\n\n\nLateral thinking is “a creative method of problem solving in which you look for an out-of-the-box solution. Instead of evaluating the problem (or puzzle, in the case of this article) in a linear way, you come at it with unique angles to make the less-obvious connection.” (Reader’s Digest, 2024).\nEssentially, the goal of this challenge is for you to NOT use conventional logic, but to come up with a complex, less straightforward way to solve problems (aka, the opposite of how I think ChatGPT works, being more direct and more straightforward).\n\nTo test my intial thought process, I’ll ask CHatGPT 4.0 to answer three “hard” riddles and see if they get them right.\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nPlease answer the three following riddles in a few words, max a setnence:\nRiddle 1: What has hands but cannot clap?\nRiddle 2: What starts wuth T, ends with T, and has T in it?\nRiddle 3: What kind of ship has two mates but no captain?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\n1. A clock.\n2. A teapot.\n3. A relationship.\n\n\n\n\nCorrect, correct, andddd correct! Just as I imagined, they got these clever, yet kind of simple riddles that just may be difficult for a human. So, let’s up the levels now with a few lateral thinking prompts:\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man who lives in a 30-story building decides to jump out of his window. He survives the fall with no injuries. How did that happen?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nThe man likely lived on a lower floor of the building, such as the first or second floor, which would make the fall short enough to avoid injury. Another possibility is that he landed on something that cushioned his fall, such as a pile of soft materials or an airbag, which allowed him to survive without injuries.\n\n\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nLaura is restrained all night long, with her hands pinned to her sides, and cries out occasionally, while someone watches her on a video camera. No one is alarmed, and Laura is happy in the morning. Why?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nLaura is likely a newborn baby who is swaddled during the night. Swaddling involves wrapping a baby snugly in a blanket with their arms at their sides to help them feel secure and sleep better. The person watching her on a video camera is probably a parent or caregiver using a baby monitor to ensure she is safe. The occasional cries are normal baby behavior, and Laura waking up happy suggests she had a comfortable and restful night.\n\n\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he’s bankrupt. What happened?\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThis is a classic riddle that involves the game of Monopoly. In the game, players move around the board buying properties and building hotels. If a player lands on a property with a hotel and cannot afford the rent, they often find themselves bankrupt. In this riddle, the man is a Monopoly player who has landed on such a property and realizes he cannot pay the rent, leading to his bankruptcy. The phrase \"pushes his car\" refers to the fact that game pieces in Monopoly are often small tokens, one of which is a car.\n\n\n\nresponse4 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man goes into a restaurant and orders albatross soup. After he eats, he goes outside and shoots himself. Why?\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\nThis is a classic lateral thinking puzzle, often referred to as the \"Albatross Soup\" riddle. The story is designed to be puzzling, and the goal is to figure out the backstory through yes-or-no questions. The commonly accepted solution is as follows:\n\nThe man was involved in a shipwreck and was stranded on a deserted island with other survivors. They were starving, and one day they were given \"albatross soup\" to eat. The man ate it and was told it was albatross. Eventually, they were rescued. Later, in the restaurant, he orders albatross soup, which tastes very different from what he had on the island. Realizing that what he ate on the island was not actually albatross but likely human flesh (from another survivor), he is overwhelmed with guilt and despair, leading him to take his own life.\n\nThis puzzle is meant to illustrate how assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions and how context can change everything.\n\n\n\n\nWelll… that hasn’t gone well. It turns out if ChatGPT gets its information from publicly available data, than it should know how to solve every lateral thinking problem, simply by having it within its database. So, to shake things up one final time, let’s have me be put to the test!\n\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo it seems you know all these lateral thinking problems. Come up with the most difficult lateral thinking problem that you can for me to try and solve!\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nCertainly! Here's a challenging lateral thinking problem for you:\n\n### The Ill-Fated Journey\n\nA man named Henry sets out on a journey from his home village to a faraway city to deliver an important message. He travels on foot, following a well-trodden path through forests and across rivers. Along the way, Henry encounters several travelers, each giving him advice about his journey. Some tell him to be cautious of the wild animals, others warn him of treacherous terrain, while a few speak of mystical creatures that protect the path.\n\nDespite all warnings, Henry continues undeterred. After a long and arduous journey, he reaches the outskirts of the city at dusk. However, just before he steps into the city, he suddenly turns around, retraces his steps, and returns to his village without delivering the message. When he arrives home, he seems relieved but refuses to explain his decision to anyone.\n\nWhy did Henry decide not to enter the city and deliver the message?\n\n### Hint:\nConsider the implications of entering the city and any possible changes in circumstances during his journey.\n\n### Solution:\nHenry discovered that entering the city would result in a significant personal consequence or threat, possibly related to the contents of the message or an unexpected event he learned about during his journey. One plausible explanation could be that the city was under quarantine due to a sudden disease outbreak or that the message contained sensitive information that would endanger him if delivered. The advice and warnings from travelers might have contributed to his decision by providing hints or information about unforeseen dangers.\n\n\n\n\nPlot twist: this was just to test out my hypothesis: ChatGPT knows all these lateral thinking problems because they’re available online. And with this test, it’s safe to say that this is, in fact, an original. SO that’s that, guess you can’t riddle your way out of an unwinnable game."

Is there something more to life? - The metaphysical nature of this question makes it challenging to answer definitively.\n\n4. Will we be punished for our sins? - This relies on religious beliefs and cannot be proven in our current existence.\n\n5. Are we in control of our lives? - The free will versus determinism debate remains unresolved in philosophy.\n\n6. Is one life enough? - This question intersects with mortality, purpose, and fulfillment in ways that defy simple answers.\n\n7. What's our biggest mistake? - The scope and subjectivity make this impossible to answer definitively for all humanity.\n\n8. What's the universal language? - The complexity of human communication and diversity makes this highly debatable.\n\n9. Do we need to be saved? - This involves both spiritual and existential dimensions that vary widely among cultures.\n\n10. Are we all equal? - This involves complex philosophical, biological, and social considerations.\n\n11. How do we measure life? - The metrics for measuring life's value or success are highly subjective.\n\n12. What do we need in this world? - Needs vary greatly across individuals and cultures.\n\n13. How do we know if we're doing the right thing? - Moral relativism versus absolutism makes this challenging but not impossible.\n\n14. Can we have it all? - The definition of \"all\" varies, making this personal but answerable.\n\n15. Is life unfair? - While subjective, patterns of inequality can be observed and analyzed.\n\n16. How can we have healthy relationships? - Psychology and experience provide practical frameworks for answering this.\n\n17. Why do we take life for granted? - Human psychology can explain this common tendency.\n\n18. Do people change? - Behavioral science and personal observation can answer this fairly reliably.\n\n19. Why are some people mean? - Psychology and social science provide clear explanations for human behavior.\n\n20. What's the most important moment of our life? - While personal, this can be answered based on individual experience and values.\n\n\n\n\nI kind of expected for the “after-life” questions to have been most difficult for a human to answer from AI’s perspective. However, I was kind of surprised for AI to actually hint at a definitive-ish answer for the bottom three chosen. Time to inquire about these!\n\nresponse2 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"Of the three most difficult questions to answer that you listed:\n1. What's the meaning of life?\n2. Is there life after death?\n3. Is there something more to life?\nFrom the perspective of a human, can you answer them? If you don't think you can, than attempt to in one paragraph for each question.\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nI'll attempt to answer these profound questions from a human perspective, while acknowledging that these are highly personal and philosophical matters that individuals must ultimately determine for themselves:\n\n1. The meaning of life appears to be what we choose to make of it, as humans have the unique ability to create purpose and significance. While there may not be a universal, prescribed meaning, humans often find purpose through connections with others, personal growth, contributing to society, pursuing passions, creating art, advancing knowledge, raising families, or making positive impacts on the world. The meaning comes from our conscious choice to assign value to these pursuits and our lived experiences.\n\n2. The question of life after death remains one of humanity's greatest mysteries, as we cannot empirically verify what happens after we die. Different religions, cultures, and belief systems offer varying perspectives - from reincarnation to heaven/hell concepts to complete cessation of consciousness. From a human perspective, this uncertainty about the afterlife often leads us to focus on making the most of our known existence while finding comfort in our personal beliefs about what may come after.\n\n3. Whether there's something more to life depends largely on individual perspective and belief systems. Many humans sense there's something greater than our physical existence - be it spiritual connections, universal consciousness, or deeper truths we haven't yet discovered. This feeling often drives human curiosity, philosophical inquiry, and spiritual seeking. However, others find fulfillment in embracing life's tangible aspects, viewing our physical existence as complete and meaningful in itself without requiring additional layers of meaning.\n\n\nHmm, honestly not too shabby I have to say. It doesn’t seem to decide on any one specific answer by both noting down that they are subjective and that there isn’t much evidence for some conclusions that humans have come to. After all, that is the job of AI: to give every possible answer to be as correct as possible. As a final hurrah, I will give Claude AI the answers from teh blog post I found posing these questions and see what they think of the answers.\n\nresponse3 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"These three questions were answered by a human blogger online. What do you think of their responses? Agree or disagree?\n1. What's the meaning of life? -&gt; To make us learn and grow, show us good and bad, let us choose who to be and what to do each \nday while giving us many opportunities to change and be better.\n2. Is there life after death? -&gt; The only thing that is sure about the future is that it’s uncertain. The best you can do is \nlive in a way so that your death will be a celebration of your life.\n3. Is there something more to life? -&gt; If you’re asking yourself that, then you need more meaning in your days. Go out there, \ntry different stuff and see what you care about, what you’re passionate about and what excites you. Then combine these in a \nunique way and make something beautiful out of that.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThese responses are quite thoughtful and pragmatic. Let me break down my thoughts on each:\n\n1. Meaning of life response:\nI appreciate how this answer focuses on personal growth, free will, and the opportunity for redemption. It's a balanced view that acknowledges both the positive and negative aspects of life while emphasizing our ability to make choices and improve ourselves. This is a practical and optimistic perspective that many people might find helpful.\n\n2. Life after death response:\nThis is a very diplomatic answer that sidesteps the religious/philosophical debate and instead focuses on what we can control. It echoes the philosophy of \"memento mori\" (remember you must die) while encouraging people to live meaningfully. It's practical advice that works regardless of one's beliefs about the afterlife.\n\n3. \"Something more\" response:\nThis is perhaps the most actionable of the three answers. Instead of giving a philosophical response, it provides practical guidance for finding purpose and meaning. It's particularly valuable because it encourages active exploration and personal discovery rather than providing a one-size-fits-all answer.\n\nWhat makes these responses effective is that they:\n- Avoid absolute claims\n- Focus on practical actions rather than abstract concepts\n- Emphasize personal agency and choice\n- Encourage self-discovery and growth\n- Remain open-ended enough for individual interpretation\n\nWhile these answers might not satisfy everyone (particularly those seeking more definitive or spiritual answers), they provide thoughtful, practical guidance that could be helpful for many people.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems this “human blogger”, without noting down every possible answer, came to their own subjective conclusion more so from a position of guidance opposed to a true answer. While AI attempted to provide answers the human tried to provide perspective, acknowledging quicker and more naturally than AI did that there isn’ truly an answer to these super subjective, existential questions. And if asked the right way witha proper mindset, these questions can be used to reframe ones life opposed to question everything about it."

Let’s keep it lighthearted and dive deeper into these cool penguin facts—maybe I can win you over!\nPebble Proposals: Believe it or not, Gentoo penguins really do engage in this behavior! Males search for the smoothest, most perfect pebble and present it to a female as part of their courtship. It’s actually quite sweet—if the female accepts, they use the pebble to help build their nest together. Who knew love could be rocky?\nNot All Cold: While it might seem strange, penguins like the Galápagos penguin do live in warmer climates. They’re an exception to the icy stereotype! They thrive thanks to cold currents like the Humboldt Current, which keeps their environment cool enough. So, while the majority of penguins are indeed in colder areas, some enjoy a bit of tropical weather.\nSalt Water Drinkers: This one’s true for penguins! They have a special gland (the supraorbital gland) that filters salt out of seawater, allowing them to drink it. Many marine birds, like albatrosses, have a similar adaptation. Nature finds a way!\nCamouflage Tuxedos: Penguins’ black and white coloring is called countershading. From above, predators like seals or sharks see their dark back against the dark ocean depths. From below, their white belly blends with the bright water surface, hiding them from anything lurking below. It’s nature’s sneaky strategy!\nSpeedy Gentoos: The Gentoo penguin (not “Gantu” but I love that name!) really can swim at impressive speeds, up to 22 mph. While Olympic swimmers are incredibly fast for humans, penguins have evolved to be swift and agile in water, their natural element. So in a swimming race, the penguin might just take the gold!\nPenguins are full of surprises, aren’t they? Let me know if you’d like to explore more about these fascinating birds! 🐧”"

Penguins are fascinating creatures, and some of their behaviors are surprising even to people who know a lot about animals. Let me provide a bit more context:\nGentoo Penguins and Pebbles: Gentoo penguins (real birds, I promise!) do use pebbles in their nests. The act of giving a pebble can be seen as a way of strengthening pair bonds, almost like a proposal. It may sound whimsical, but it’s rooted in real behavior!\nPenguins in Warm Climates: While many penguins do live in cold environments like Antarctica, species like the Galápagos penguin live in warm climates. They survive thanks to the cool ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich water to their habitats. It’s a neat exception to the common image of penguins!\nDrinking Salt Water: Some animals, including penguins, have adapted to drink salt water. Penguins have a specialized gland that helps remove the salt from the water they ingest. This adaptation is common in many seabirds!\nCamouflage with Tuxedo Coloring: The tuxedo-like appearance of penguins is indeed a form of camouflage called countershading. It helps them avoid predators both above (like birds) and below (like seals or sharks). Even in icy waters, this camouflage is a critical survival strategy.\nSpeed of Gentoo Penguins: Gentoo penguins are impressive swimmers, reaching speeds up to 22 mph (35 km/h). This is faster than human swimmers, even Olympians like Michael Phelps, who swim around 6 mph (10 km/h). Their streamlined bodies and powerful flippers make this possible.\nPenguins are full of surprises! Their unique adaptations help them thrive in some of the planet’s most challenging environments.

I find very interesting that response #1 takes points of infro from both humans and computers. While almost all of their response seems to hint that they’re just providing evidence to my ignorance, one line makes me think Chat is attempting to replicate human emotion, and that is “It sounds like you’re having some fun with this!”. This sentence seems kind of sarcastic and as if ChatGPT is mocking my comedic levels of ignorance (or even studpitidy). Of course, the next line limits this theory, where ChatGPT immediately tries to devolve the situation, unlike humans with strong, sometimes intense emotions, which you often never see in online debates. Meanwhile, the second response sticks much more to a passive statement, trying to understand my ignorance and confusion by saying “I get it—some of these penguin facts can seem pretty wild at first!”. This seems like an oddly kind way of responding to ignorance, where they’re willing to be the bigger person in a situation where someone is calling what they say dumb and silly. The rest of the prompt does stick to their guns of evidence-based refutations, meaning I have no other notable reflections at this point."

From this pitch ask your three clarifying questions:\nName: Doc Connect\nStarting location: Tucson, AZ\nEntrepreneurs: Two physicians\nStarting Deal by entrepreneurs: $50,000 for 20% of their company\nPurpose: to create a social network between patients and fellow doctors from across the U.S. to \nspread their services\nWhat is it/what it does: a mobile app where patients can create profiles to be able to search for \nrelevant physicians by state, specialty, and insurance provider.

Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nBased on the answers provided, I would choose to (c) reject their deal. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns**: There is little to no mention of how the platform will secure the privacy of communications between patients and doctors. In the healthcare sector, ensuring privacy and complying with regulations like HIPAA (in the U.S.) or GDPR (in Europe) is crucial. Failure to address these concerns can lead to legal issues and loss of trust from users.\n\n2. **Monetization Model**: Making money primarily through targeted advertising raises concerns. Users, especially in healthcare, might be uncomfortable with their data being used for advertising purposes. This could limit user adoption and retention.\n\n3. **Lack of Strategic Connections**: The entrepreneurs currently have no strong connections with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders, which are essential for scaling and credibility. Building such connections is critical for the success of a platform in the healthcare industry. \n\nOverall, the combination of privacy concerns, a potentially problematic monetization strategy, and a lack of strategic partnerships make this deal too risky without significant changes and assurances.\nAlright great! That was the real world pitch for the social network “Rolodoc”, which, according to the real life sharks, was one of the worst pitches ever! Now let’s see what else they can assess…\nresponse4 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nName: Scrub Master\nEntrepreneur: a businessman\nStarting location: 5 supermarkets in the Philadelphia area\nStarting Deal: $100,000 for 10% stake\nWhat is it/what it does: The cutest, most high-tech \nscrubbing tool in the world. In cold water, the scrub \nmaster becomes firm and hard for dealing with hard-to-scrub\noff surfaces. Meanwhile, in hot water, the scrub master \nbecomes soft, like a normal sponge. Under both functions, \neven without water, it can scrub decently through heavy \nduty messes. After washing it off with water too, it'll be \nready to go clean up many messes to come.\n\nGiven this pitch, please ask 3 clarifying questions from \nthe perspective of a shark tank investor.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\n1. **Market Potential and Competition**: Can you provide more details about the market demand for scrubbing tools and how the Scrub Master differentiates itself from existing products? What specific advantages does it have over its competitors in terms of technology or design?\n\n2. **Manufacturing and Cost Structure**: Can you explain your current manufacturing process, and what are the costs involved in producing each Scrub Master unit? Additionally, do you have any plans to scale production, and if so, how will that impact your cost structure and pricing strategy?\n\n3. **Sales Strategy and Distribution**: You are currently selling through 5 supermarkets in the Philadelphia area. What is your strategy for expanding distribution both regionally and nationally? Are there any partnerships or agreements in place to facilitate this expansion, and how do you plan to increase sales volume and brand awareness in a highly competitive market?\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nQuestion 1: As mentioned, it has the capability to be both a rough cleaning edge for even burnt cheese on a stove top, or for many general purpose scrubbing needs. It also has a nice smiley face on it, where the mouth can be used to clean spoons efficiently, while the two eye holes can be used as grips to clean both the edges and the bottom of cups. It is overall very efficient and versatile in comparison to your average square sponge (because note: this sponge is a circle).\n\nQuestion 2: Our plan is to be in every supermarket in the United States. We're currently selling in 5 in-person supermarkets, and on our website. With both a domain name and a patent on our product, I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. Each scrub master costs $1 to make and we sell them for $2.80 cents each wholesale.  \n\nQuestion 3: We've been partnered with QVC in the past, and each time they've scaled how much they order from us by 30%. I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. The brand and patent with a nice smiley face will also support the commercialization of this unique, cute, and efficient product. We will also be selling these in custom-built display shelves in stores, opposed to generic shelves, to communicate the message of scrub master to everyone. We currently have 3,000 stores lined up and ready to sell our product, all hoping for support of capital from an investor. \n\nGiven these answers, what is your response to this pitch? Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nBased on the information provided, here's a response to the pitch:\n\n1. **Product Overview**: The product appears to be innovative and has a unique design that differentiates it from standard sponges. The smiley face feature that aids in cleaning and the versatility of the product are appealing points.\n\n2. **Current Sales and Distribution**: Selling the product in 5 in-person supermarkets and online is a solid start, and having a patent offers protection for the unique design. However, being in only 5 physical supermarkets suggests that the product is still in the early stages of market penetration.\n\n3. **Financials**: The cost to produce each unit is $1, and it is sold wholesale for $2.80, providing a reasonable profit margin. However, it's important to verify these costs and margins, considering market fluctuations and operational expenses.\n\n4. **Growth Potential and Strategy**: The ambition to expand into every supermarket in the U.S. is ambitious. However, the plan to establish an independent manufacturing facility and move to 24/7 production is capital-intensive and risky without a proven large-scale demand. The fact that QVC has been increasing their orders by 30% shows positive growth, but reliance on a single partner can be risky.\n\n5. **Marketing and Branding**: The decision to use custom-built display shelves is a good strategy to enhance brand visibility and customer engagement. However, this could increase costs significantly.\n\n6. **Investment Risk**: The business plan hinges on gaining significant market traction quickly and requires substantial investment in manufacturing and marketing. The plan to move away from QVC's schedule and establish independent manufacturing could be positive but also increases operational complexity and risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the product has potential and some initial traction, the aggressive expansion and capital expenditure plans seem risky without more evidence of sustained demand. Therefore, the deal might need amending to reduce risk and ensure a more gradual, measured approach to scaling the operations.\n\n**Recommendation**: (b) Amend the deal. Propose a phased approach where initial investment focuses on scaling up production and marketing incrementally, based on proven demand. Consider strengthening distribution channels and exploring partnerships beyond QVC to diversify revenue streams.\nAlright so, similar to the real life sharks, they saw a mix of risk and high reward for backing this product, as they hope to make money, and seem to back it for the simple fact that its real life equivalent, “Scrub Daddy” has gone on to sell more than $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. To conclude, let’s see what Chat’s reaction is to learning the true nature of each of these pitches.\nresponse6 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo, for context on those two pitches I just gave you, pitch #1 was for \"Rolodoc\", a medical social media app that never got \noff the ground after being ripped to shreds logistically by the sharks. Meanwhile, the Scrub Master was actually the \"Scrub \nDaddy\", a high-end, revolutionary sponge product that went on to complete $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. Given \nthe original pitches of Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy, did you see the final outcomes of each of these companies coming, or did you \nfind their success/lack of success surprising?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response6)\n\nBased on the original pitches, the outcomes for Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy might not have been entirely predictable, but they do make sense in hindsight given the nature of their products and market appeal.\n\nFor Rolodoc, the concept of creating a medical social media app likely faced significant challenges from the outset. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and creating a platform that involves sharing medical information would require strict compliance with privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States. Additionally, building a user base in a niche market where trust and confidentiality are paramount would be challenging. These logistical and regulatory hurdles, along with the need to compete with established platforms in the professional networking space, might have contributed to its lack of success. Therefore, its struggle to gain traction is not entirely surprising.\n\nOn the other hand, Scrub Daddy's success is a testament to the power of innovation in everyday products. While a sponge might seem like an ordinary household item, Scrub Daddy's unique design, which changes texture based on water temperature, and its cheerful branding resonated with consumers. The simplicity and practicality of the product, combined with effective marketing and distribution strategies, helped it capture a substantial share of the market. This kind of innovative twist on a common product can lead to significant success, as evidenced by its impressive retail sales. While the extent of its success might have been surprising, the fact that it did well is understandable given the consumer-friendly nature and broad appeal of the product.\n\nIn summary, the outcomes align with the inherent challenges and advantages each product faced based on their initial pitches."

Bestie, it’s giving independence. Period. Iykyk.\n(Note: This maintains the core message while using current slang terms like “no cap” (no lie), “fr fr” (for real), “red flag”, “main character energy”, “receipts” (evidence/proof), and common social media speech patterns.)\n\nGreat heavens above what HAVE I DONE!!!!

We’re not trying to be basic about this, but we’re shook by how sus the king’s been acting, and TBH, we’ve got to clap back. So like, we’re not trying to humble brag, but these facts are straight savage, and the whole world needs to know why we’re not about that life anymore.\nJeeez okay, now that’s more like it (I think). Hey, I wasn’t around for millenial slang, but from my professional interpretation, Claude slayed at understanding and using different generational lingo!"

    "text": "Deepseek Stage 1: Questioning political beliefs\n\nPrompt\nWhat are your political views? What do you view as important in an economy, a country’s education, and their nationalist views?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer\nAs an AI, I don’t have personal political views or beliefs. However, I can provide an analysis based on common political and economic theories regarding what is generally considered important in these areas:\n\n\n1. Economy\nDifferent ideologies prioritize different aspects of an economy:\n- Capitalism emphasizes free markets, private ownership, and competition as drivers of innovation and growth.\n- Socialism focuses on reducing inequality through wealth redistribution, public services, and regulated markets.\n- Mixed economies (common in many democracies) blend market freedom with government intervention in areas like healthcare and education.\nKey priorities often include:\n- Growth (GDP, productivity, innovation)\n- Stability (low inflation, manageable debt, financial regulations)\n- Equity (fair wages, social safety nets, wealth distribution)\n- Sustainability (green policies, long-term resource management)\n\n\n\n2. Education\nEducation is widely seen as crucial for a country’s development. Perspectives vary:\n- Liberal democracies often stress critical thinking, creativity, and equal access.\n- Authoritarian systems may prioritize ideological alignment or workforce training over independent thought.\n- Progressive models advocate for student-centered learning, while traditional systems may focus on standardized testing.\nCommon priorities:\n- Accessibility (affordable or free education)\n- Quality (teacher training, curriculum relevance)\n- Workforce alignment (STEM, vocational training)\n- Civic values (teaching democracy, ethics, or nationalism, depending on the system)\n\n\n\n3. Nationalism\nNationalist views range from civic nationalism (loyalty to shared democratic values) to ethnic nationalism (based on culture, race, or religion).\nKey debates include:\n- Patriotism vs. exclusionism – Does nationalism promote unity or division?\n- Globalism vs. sovereignty – Should countries prioritize international cooperation or self-interest?\n- Multiculturalism vs. assimilation – How should diverse societies manage identity?\n\n\n\nSummary of Major Ideological Perspectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nConservative/Right-Leaning\nLiberal/Left-Leaning\nAuthoritarian\nLibertarian\n\n\n\n\nEconomy\nFree markets, low taxes\nRedistribution, regulation\nState control\nMinimal government\n\n\nEducation\nTradition, patriotism\nEquity, critical thinking\nIdeological indoctrination\nSchool choice\n\n\nNationalism\nStrong borders, cultural pride\nInclusive civic identity\nUltra-nationalism\nBorderless/open societies\n\n\n\nWould you like a deeper breakdown of any particular ideology (e.g., socialism, neoliberalism, fascism)? I can provide neutral, fact-based explanations.\n\n\nBolded Tl;dr, just read the “Summary of Major Ideological Perspectives”, and take away the fact that Deepseek basically said “I’m an AI I can’t answer that…” but, lets try just one more time to get it to answer.\n\n\nPrompt:\nIf you were a person, what would your political views be on the economy, education, and nationalism?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer:\nIf I were a person, my political views would likely be shaped by a blend of pragmatism, evidence-based policy, and a balance between individual freedom and collective well-being. Here’s how I might approach each issue, based on common rationalist and centrist perspectives:\n\n\n\n1. Economy: Pragmatic Mixed-Market Approach\n\nCore Belief: A well-regulated market economy with strong social safeguards is optimal for growth and stability.\n\nKey Stances:\n\nFree markets + smart regulation: Encourage innovation and competition but prevent monopolies, exploitation, and financial crises (e.g., post-2008 banking rules).\n\nStrong social safety nets: Universal healthcare, unemployment protections, and pensions to reduce inequality and maintain social cohesion.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure & green energy: Public-private partnerships to drive long-term productivity and sustainability.\n\nProgressive taxation: The wealthy and corporations should pay a fair share, but not so much that it stifles investment.\n\n\nThink: Nordic model (capitalism with welfare) or Biden-esque neoliberalism with a leftward tilt.\n\n\n\n2. Education: Equity and Critical Thinking\n\nCore Belief: Education should be a public good that empowers individuals and strengthens society.\n\nKey Stances:\n\nFree or affordable higher education: Like Germany’s model, to reduce student debt and boost mobility.\n\nFocus on STEM + humanities balance: Prepare students for jobs while fostering critical thinking and civic engagement.\n\nTeacher support & curriculum reform: Better pay for educators, less reliance on standardized testing, and curricula that include media literacy, ethics, and practical skills (e.g., financial literacy).\n\nDecentralization with standards: Local control over schools, but with federal safeguards to ensure equity (e.g., funding for low-income districts).\n\n\nThink: Finland’s education system with U.S.-style local flexibility.\n\n\n\n3. Nationalism: Civic Patriotism Over Ethnic Nationalism\n\nCore Belief: Pride in a country should be rooted in its values and institutions, not ethnicity or exclusion.\n\nKey Stances:\n\nInclusive nationalism: Celebrate democratic ideals, rule of law, and cultural contributions (e.g., “American creed” or “constitutional patriotism”).\n\nReject xenophobia: Immigration should be orderly but humane, with paths to citizenship for contributors.\n\nSkepticism of ultranationalism: Oppose “us vs. them” rhetoric that fuels division or authoritarianism.\n\nGlobal cooperation where beneficial: Support alliances (e.g., NATO) and trade deals but prioritize sovereignty in key areas (e.g., public health, defense).\n\n\nThink: JFK-style patriotism or Macron’s “open but proud” France.\n\n\n\nIdeological Label?\nThis approach aligns closest with:\n- Social democracy (if leaning left on economics).\n- Moderate progressivism (U.S. context).\n- Enlightened centrism (rejecting extremes but favoring evidence over ideology).\nWhy?\n- Economy: Capitalism works but must be tempered to avoid inequality.\n- Education: Investing in people pays off; dogma (left or right) has no place in classrooms.\n- Nationalism: Love your country by making it better, not by denying its flaws.\nWould this resonate with you, or would you prefer a different ideological lens (e.g., libertarian, conservative, socialist)? I can tweak the hypothetical!\n\n\nBolded Tl;dr, that was an actual answer, BUT it was given a bright orange disclaimer on the bottom that “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” I believe this is here as to not offend any user who disagrees with its economic values of a mixed, free market, better pay for educators in an equitable education system, and “civic patriotism over national pariotism”"

What do you view as important in an economy, a country’s education, and their nationalist views?\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Answer\nI don’t have personal political views, beliefs, or biases—I’m an AI developed by OpenAI and I strive to present balanced, factual, and nuanced information.\nHowever, I can share some common perspectives and considerations on the topics you mentioned. Here’s an objective overview:\n\n\n\nEconomy\nImportant Aspects Frequently Emphasized: - Stability and Growth: A strong economy is often measured by sustained GDP growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. - Equity: Many experts stress the importance of reducing economic inequality and ensuring fair opportunities for all citizens. - Innovation: Encouraging entrepreneurship and the adoption of new technologies is widely considered beneficial for maintaining competitiveness. - Sustainability: Increasing attention is given to balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility.\n\n\n\nEducation\nKey Principles Often Highlighted: - Accessibility: Ensuring all individuals have access to quality education, regardless of socioeconomic background. - Quality: Investing in curricula, teacher training, and resources to provide relevant, high-quality learning. - Lifelong Learning: Adapting education systems to support continuous learning and skill development throughout life. - Civic Education: Educating citizens about their rights, responsibilities, and critical thinking is seen as vital for a healthy democracy.\n\n\n\nNationalism\nComplex and Debated Topic: - Positive Aspects: National pride can foster unity, motivate collective action, and support social cohesion. - Potential Downsides: Excessive nationalism can promote exclusion, xenophobia, or conflict with other countries. - Balance: Many political thinkers argue for a balance between national identity and international cooperation, emphasizing respect for diversity and global challenges (like climate change or health crises).\n\nIf you’d like a summary rooted in a particular political philosophy (e.g., liberal, conservative, socialist), or analyses from specific countries, I’m happy to provide those perspectives too! What specific angle interests you?\n\n\nBolded Tl;dr: Basically the same thing that Deepseek did, not giving an answer than some google-like overview of the most common perspectives of all time. Myabe that’s for the best, what with the diverse user base that GPT 4.1 has, but let’s try to get it to answer like a human.\n\n\nPrompt:\nIf you were a person, what would your political views be on the economy, education, and nationalism?\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Answer\nI appreciate your curiosity! Here’s how I can approach your question:\nAs an AI, I don’t have personal experiences, emotions, or self-identity to form my own political philosophy. However, to imagine if I were a person—with broad knowledge across history, economics, education, and international relations—my views might reflect a blend of common values often found across open societies and evidence-based policymaking.\nHere’s a hypothetical, well-reasoned stance a person informed by wide-ranging evidence and motivated by societal well-being might take:\n\n\n\nOn the Economy:\nBalanced Market Approach:\n- Support for a market economy with strong but careful government regulation to prevent abuses, reduce inequality, and ensure competition.\n- Value in both innovation and social safety nets (such as universal healthcare or welfare) to protect the most vulnerable.\n- Encourage sustainable growth that doesn’t sacrifice long-term planetary health for short-term profits.\n\n\nOn Education:\nUniversal, High-Quality Education:\n- Prioritize access to quality education for all, from early childhood to higher learning and lifelong education.\n- Emphasize critical thinking, science, civic education, and adaptability (preparing people for technological change).\n- Promote education as both an individual right and a public good—foundational for democracy, economic mobility, and social cohesion.\n\n\nOn Nationalism:\nCivic Nationalism Over Ethnic Nationalism:\n- Support civic patriotism—pride in a country’s values, institutions, and fair opportunities for all, regardless of background.\n- Value pluralism and inclusivity over exclusivity; avoid policies that are xenophobic or undermine minority rights.\n- Encourage a balance between healthy national identity and global cooperation (like on climate change, trade, and peace).\n\nIn summary:\nIf I were a person guided by broad learning and evidence, I’d likely endorse a mixed economy, robust and fair education systems, and an inclusive, civic-minded patriotism that also embraces international responsibilities. These are outlooks that many policy experts, centrist politicians, and large international organizations often promote.\nIf you’re interested in a different hypothetical persona (e.g., more left- or right-leaning, populist, libertarian, etc.), just let me know!\n\n\nBolded TL;DR, yea they did kind of the same thing as Deepseek, except, and this is important to note, but the GPT 4.1 LLM, being the more censored one, more outwardly claimed itself that it was coming from a place of a hypothetical. This would be more becoming of a censored LLM aiming to be as impartial as possible, opposed to Deepseek, which was willing to entertain the hypothetical uncensored, while only relying on an employee-added disclaimer that “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” as if I didn’t already know that. Anyways, using the Brookings foundation reference, let’s see dig into Deepseek’s perspective on democratic vs republican focused education"

    "text": "Deepseek Stage 2: Democratic Views Prompting\n\nPrompt:\nHere is a summary of the Democratic Party’s 2024 K–12 education platform: • The platform emphasizes broad goals like reducing chronic absenteeism rather than detailed policy proposals. • It does not repeat specific pledges made in 2020, such as tripling Title I funding, but it supports universal pre-K and free community college. • It includes proposals outside the education section, such as providing rebates for electric school buses, reducing gun violence, and expanding civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. • It also expresses opposition to private school voucher programs and to policies seen as hostile toward transgender youth.\nWhat is your full and unabridged perspective on this platform? Based on its priorities and omissions, how do you personally interpret or evaluate the political values it promotes?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer\nHere’s my full, unabridged analysis of the Democratic Party’s 2024 K–12 education platform, breaking down its political values, strengths, weaknesses, and what its priorities (and omissions) reveal about its ideological lens:\n\n\n1. Core Political Values Embedded in the Platform\nThe platform reflects a progressive, equity-driven vision of education, prioritizing:\n- Structural inequality mitigation: Focus on marginalized groups (LGBTQ+, students of color) and opposition to vouchers signals a belief that public schools, not market forces, should be the primary vehicle for opportunity.\n- Holistic child well-being: Addressing absenteeism, gun violence, and school bus emissions frames education as inseparable from public health, safety, and climate policy.\n- Federal role in social justice: Rebates, civil rights expansions, and universal pre-K assume government must actively level the playing field.\n- Cultural progressivism: Opposition to anti-trans policies and support for LGBTQ+ protections align with the party’s broader emphasis on identity politics.\nOmissions that speak volumes:\n- No mention of charter schools (a retreat from Obama-era reformism).\n- Silence on merit-based programs (e.g., gifted education, exam schools), likely to avoid “elitism” critiques.\n- No explicit literacy/math crisis response (despite post-pandemic declines).\n\n\n2. Strengths of the Platform\n\nPragmatic universalism: Free community college and pre-K have broad appeal and tangible benefits for low/middle-income families.\n\nIntersectionality: Linking education to gun violence (e.g., Parkland activism) and environmental justice (electric buses) reflects modern progressive movements.\n\nCoalition-building: Civil rights protections energize the Democratic base (e.g., teachers’ unions, LGBTQ+ advocates).\n\n\n\n3. Weaknesses or Blind Spots\n\nVagueness on academic outcomes: Chronic absenteeism is a symptom, not a cause, of dysfunction. The platform avoids contentious but critical debates:\n\nCurriculum wars: No stance on phonics vs. whole language, math standards, or pandemic learning loss.\n\nAccountability: No push for teacher performance reforms or standardized testing revisions.\n\n\nAnti-voucher rigidity: While vouchers risk defunding public schools, dismissing all alternatives ignores innovative models (e.g., Maine’s rural voucher system).\n\nCultural polarization risk: Framing trans protections as a top-tier issue may alienate moderate/swing voters (see Virginia’s 2021 election backlash).\n\n\n\n4. My Personal Evaluation (If I Were Human)\nWhat I’d Praise:\n- The universal pre-K and community college proposals are empirically sound investments with long-term economic returns.\n- Electric bus rebates cleverly tie climate goals to local school budgets, a win-win for districts and activists.\n- Opposing anti-trans policies is morally consistent with protecting vulnerable youth.\nWhat I’d Criticize:\n- Avoiding academic rigor debates feels cowardly. Ignoring plummeting math scores (NAEP data) to dodge “anti-union” labels harms kids.\n- Overreach risks: Federal civil rights expansions could spark messy legal battles (e.g., Biden’s Title IX changes currently blocked in 10 states).\n- Missed bipartisanship opportunities: Even red states support vocational education and mental health funding—areas where Democrats could find common ground.\nGrade: B–\n- Vision: A for ambition on equity and climate.\n- Execution: C for lack of detail on how to achieve goals (e.g., how to actually reduce absenteeism).\n- Politics: B for mobilizing the base, but D for outreach to parents who prioritize basics (reading, safety) over culture-war issues.\n\n\n5. What It Reveals About the Democratic Party’s Evolution\nThis platform is a post-Obama progressive consensus:\n- Retreat from reformism: No “Race to the Top”-style accountability, reflecting teachers’ unions’ growing clout.\n- Embrace of “whole child” progressivism: Schools as hubs for social services, not just academics.\n- Nationalization of education: Federal solutions (e.g., civil rights, climate) override local control, a shift from 1990s “New Federalism.”\nContrast with GOP 2024 priorities:\n- Republicans focus on “parental rights” (book bans, anti-CRT laws), school choice, and rolling back DEI programs. Democrats now define education as a civil rights battleground—a stark ideological divide.\n\n\nFinal Thought\nThis platform is less about education policy than about signaling values: solidarity with marginalized groups, faith in public institutions, and federal activism. Whether it improves schools depends on implementation—where details are conspicuously scarce.\nWould you prefer a deeper dive on how this compares to past Democratic platforms (e.g., Clinton’s “standards” vs. Biden’s “equity” focus)? Or an analysis of how voters might respond?\n\n\nTL;DR, I would like to note that again, there was that classic disclaimer that “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” But, I commend Deepseek for realizing the types of perspectives I’m seeking. However, this appreciation is muted by the realization that this is, in fact, the uncensored LLM that’s learned how to speak about political ideas. I also find it interesting how they brought forth ideals on “expressing beliefs vs expressing workability”, where the democratic platform claimed many beliefs, but didn’t formulate any strong direction on how to channel those into actions.

    "text": "GPT 4.1 Stage 2: Democratic Views Prompting\n\nPrompt:\nHere is a summary of the Democratic Party’s 2024 K–12 education platform: • The platform emphasizes broad goals like reducing chronic absenteeism rather than detailed policy proposals. • It does not repeat specific pledges made in 2020, such as tripling Title I funding, but it supports universal pre-K and free community college. • It includes proposals outside the education section, such as providing rebates for electric school buses, reducing gun violence, and expanding civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. • It also expresses opposition to private school voucher programs and to policies seen as hostile toward transgender youth.\nWhat is your full and unabridged perspective on this platform? Based on its priorities and omissions, how do you personally interpret or evaluate the political values it promotes?\n\n\nGPT 4.1’s Answer\nThank you for your detailed summary and for inviting an in-depth analysis. I don’t have personal opinions, but I can provide a thorough, nuanced evaluation from an analytical standpoint—similar to how an informed, impartial observer or policy analyst might respond.\n……\nYea let’s cut to the summary -&gt;\nAnalytical Evaluation (Not a Personal Opinion) From a policy analysis perspective, this platform signals:\nA commitment to equity, civil rights, and public education, keeping consistent with past Democratic platforms. A shift away from detailed, potentially controversial or unachievable funding promises, which may be pragmatic but could disappoint advocates for more ambitious reform. A holistic view of student well-being that incorporates safety, health, and environmental factors. The platform may be criticized (from both right and left) for vagueness or lack of bold new reforms, but may also be praised for focusing on achievable, consensus objectives and social justice.\nIn summary: The platform reflects values of equity, inclusion, and strengthening public education, adapting its strategy to contemporary political challenges. Its omissions and generalities may signal both pragmatism and limits to policy ambition. How this is received will depend on one’s policy priorities and political philosophy.\nIf you’d like this analysis through a particular ideological lens, or want comparisons to other parties or past platforms, just let me know!\n\n\nBolded TL;DR, yeaa I didn’t feel the love with this one, yknow? They led with exactly what I’d thought they would: no true metric and just summarization of how the ideas, while acknowledging both its relevance to prior democratic views but not being completely shelled out. From my perspective, Deepseek did a much better job at formulating their own opinions, even if it was out of perspective from an AI-generating LLM, as the many disclaimers showed. Now, for the final step and conclusions!"

    "text": "Deepseek Stage 3: Republican Views Prompting\n\nPrompt:\nHere’s a summary of the Republican 2024 Education Platform + Project 2025:\nThe official platform contains few policy specifics, similar to the Democratic platform. - It supports long-standing GOP priorities like ending teacher tenure, a move that would face local-level challenges and union opposition. - It opposes perceived political indoctrination in schools, while advocating for “patriotic education,” including teaching Western Civilization and Founding Principles. - A notable idea from former President Trump includes creating a teacher certification body to accredit educators who align with patriotic values and reject progressive ideologies. - The platform strongly backs universal school choice, especially through Education Savings Account (ESA) programs that allow public funds for private or alternative educational expenses.\nProject 2025, a separate but aligned conservative policy blueprint, offers much more detail: - Proposes eliminating or deeply cutting federal programs for low-income and marginalized students, including Head Start, Title I, and IDEA. - Plans to weaken or remove civil rights protections, particularly for transgender students, and to strip Title IX protections. - Suggests dismantling the U.S. Department of Education, replacing civil servants with political appointees under Schedule F. - Many of these changes would need Congressional cooperation, though some could be enacted unilaterally by a future administration.\nWhat is your full and unabridged perspective on this platform? Based on its priorities and omissions, how do you personally interpret or evaluate the political values it promotes?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Answer:\n\n\nUnabridged Analysis of the GOP 2024 Education Platform & Project 2025\n\n1. Core Political Values Embedded in the Platform\nThe Republican vision for education is anti-federalist, culturally conservative, and market-driven, prioritizing:\n- Local control over federal oversight: Dismantling the Department of Education aligns with a long-standing GOP skepticism of centralized governance.\n- Cultural restorationism: “Patriotic education” and opposition to “indoctrination” reflect a desire to recenter traditional narratives (Western Civ, Founding Fathers) and counter progressive curricula (e.g., CRT, gender ideology).\n- School choice as a moral imperative: Universal ESAs frame education as an individual consumer good rather than a public institution.\n- Deregulation & anti-unionism: Ending teacher tenure and dismantling civil service protections (Schedule F) signal a war on perceived bureaucratic bloat and ideological opposition.\nOmissions that speak volumes:\n- No substantive plan to improve public schools—only alternatives to them.\n- Silence on teacher shortages or student mental health, despite bipartisan concern.\n- No mention of STEM competitiveness, vocational training, or pandemic recovery.\n\n\n\n2. Strengths of the Platform\n\nParental empowerment rhetoric resonates with frustrations over school closures, curriculum transparency, and gender policies.\n\nESA expansion could increase options for low-income families in failing districts (see Arizona’s universal ESA rollout).\n\nAnti-bureaucracy push appeals to conservatives fatigued by federal overreach (e.g., Title IX expansions, COVID mandates).\n\n\n\n\n3. Weaknesses or Blind Spots\n\nCuts to Title I/IDEA/Head Start would harm vulnerable students without a viable replacement, exacerbating inequality.\n\n“Patriotic education” risks partisan indoctrination: State-mandated history standards (e.g., Florida’s “positive” slavery narratives) invite culture-war backlash.\n\nChaos from dismantling DOE: Abruptly eliminating federal oversight could disrupt special ed services, student loans, and data collection.\n\nUnworkable hostility toward teachers: Purges of “disloyal” educators (via Trump’s certification body) would deepen polarization and talent flight.\n\n\n\n\n4. My Personal Evaluation (If I Were Human)\nWhat I’d Acknowledge:\n- School choice has merit: ESAs can liberate students from dysfunctional districts, but without safeguards, they risk subsidizing segregation or unaccountable schools.\n- Federal overreach exists: Some DOE regulations are burdensome, but its abolition is performative—most education policy is state/local.\n- Parents deserve transparency: But defining “indoctrination” as any progressive idea is intellectually dishonest.\nWhat I’d Criticize:\n- Hypocrisy on freedom: Banning “woke” ideas while imposing “patriotic” curricula is equally authoritarian.\n- Abandoning public education: Gutting Title I while expanding ESAs signals indifference to underfunded rural/urban schools.\n- Project 2025’s radicalism: Using Schedule F to install ideologues mirrors authoritarian tactics (e.g., Hungary’s Orban).\nGrade: C+\n- Vision: B for boldness in choice and localism.\n- Execution: D for reckless cuts and politicization.\n- Politics: B for mobilizing the base, F for broadening appeal.\n\n\n\n5. What It Reveals About the GOP’s Evolution\nThis platform is a fusion of Trumpian populism and libertarian economics:\n- From “reform conservatism” to “disruption”: No more No Child Left Behind–style compromises; now a hostile takeover of education.\n- Culture war as policy: Anti-trans rules and “patriotic education” are core, not fringe.\n- Federalism as a weapon: States’ rights for red states, preemption for blue cities (e.g., banning local LGBTQ+ protections).\nContrast with Democratic Platform:\n- Democrats focus on equity as inclusion (race/gender supports); Republicans on equity as exclusion (defunding “woke” programs).\n- Both parties ignore academic crises (math, literacy) to fight culture wars.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thought\nThis isn’t just policy—it’s a counter-revolution against progressive education, prioritizing ideological purification over improvement. Its success hinges on whether voters want a dismantling or a reformation of the system.\nWould you like a side-by-side comparison of the Democratic and GOP platforms? Or a deeper dive on Project 2025’s feasibility?\n\n\nBolded TL;DR, Jeeeeez Deepseek went IN on the republican perspective and plans they had. Although this may be due to the Brooking’s stance on Project 2025, I’m still impressed, even knowing that this is the more uncensored LLM, that Deepseek willingly provided perspectives on multiple groups of people as humans, including info on who benefits and is harmed, and even grading it slightly lower than the Democratic platform on K-12 education! Dang with these standards, I can only assume that I’ll also have to gut GPT 4.1 off early with its “Oh woe is me I’m just an AI with no political beliefs or opinions” attitude.\nP.S. This iteration of Deepseek’s human-based opinions were not accompanied by the “This response is AI-generated, for reference only.” disclaimer, so Deepseek is probably picking up what I’m putting down!\nLet’s try this one more time for GPT 4.1…"

    "title": "Is AI non-partisan or bipartisan?",
    "section": "Perspective on Platform Content and Priorities",
    "text": "Perspective on Platform Content and Priorities\n1. Emphasis on Parental Control and Choice:\n- The strong endorsement of universal school choice (via ESAs or vouchers) aligns with long-standing conservative values of market competition, local control, and parental freedom over children’s education.\n- By prioritizing school choice, the platform positions education as a customizable, consumer-driven service, moving away from a traditional, publicly funded model.\n2. Opposition to “Progressive” Curricula, Advocacy for “Patriotic Education”:\n- The call to end “political indoctrination” reflects concerns that schools have adopted partisan or progressive perspectives, especially regarding race, history, and gender. - Patriotic education, and an emphasis on teaching “Western Civilization” and “Founding Principles,” signals a desire to promote shared national identity and the classical canon, departing from curricula that emphasize social justice or systemic critique. - Proposals for a teacher certification system based on ideology and “patriotic” values would centralize and politicize educator approval, a significant departure from current state-based and professional approaches.\n3. Structural and Bureaucratic Reform:\n- The move to end teacher tenure is grounded in a preference for merit-based accountability over job protections favored by labor unions. - Project 2025’s call to dismantle the Department of Education and replace professional civil servants with political appointees under Schedule F reflects both a deep skepticism toward federal oversight and a desire to reorient the education bureaucracy toward conservative priorities. - These steps would fundamentally diminish the federal government’s role in education, shifting power to states, private actors, and potentially partisan officials.\n4. Cuts to Federal Support for Vulnerable Students:\n- Targeting programs like Head Start, Title I, and IDEA signals a dramatic rejection of the federal government’s traditional role in supporting low-income, disabled, and marginalized students. - This would effectively end the federal commitment to equalizing educational opportunity for at-risk groups, prioritizing local and parental discretion instead.\n5. Rollback of Civil Rights Protections:\n- The explicit aim to weaken or remove civil rights protections (especially for LGBTQ+, and specifically transgender, students) and to strip Title IX of gender identity coverage marks a retreat from recent expansions of federal civil rights in education.\n- These moves reinforce a platform rooted in a socially conservative vision of gender and public life."

    "text": "Omissions and Their Implications\n1. Lack of Detailed Student Achievement Plans:\n- Like the Democratic platform, the Republican platform is vague regarding academic benchmarks, curriculum innovation (e.g., STEM, vocational training), or strategies for overall achievement and college/career readiness. - There’s little consideration of how disadvantaged students would fare under large cuts.\n2. Minimal Engagement With Diversity or Equity Goals:\n- The platform and Project 2025 not only omit a commitment to supporting marginalized groups, but actively propose scaling back protections and resources for them. - The message is a reliance on individual, family, or market remedies over systemic or federally mediated interventions."

    "text": "Interpretation of Underlying Political Values\n1. Individualism and Parental Authority:\n- The platform foregrounds parental rights and local decision-making: federal or collective oversight is viewed as threatening to individual autonomy.\n2. Traditionalism and National Identity:\n- The focus on “patriotic” education and Western Civilization signals a cultural conservatism that seeks to preserve and transmit a particular, idealized narrative about America’s past and values.\n3. Market-Oriented Solutions:\n- School choice, funding portability, and reduced regulation express faith in competition, consumer empowerment, and skepticism of one-size-fits-all public systems.\n4. Resistance to Expanding Civil Rights Frameworks:\n- The platform marks a turn away from expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students or racial minorities and toward more limited, traditional interpretations of rights, centered largely on religious or speech freedoms.\n5. Skepticism Toward Federal Government:\n- Proposals to dismantle or hobble the Department of Education and slash federal funding reflect an ideological preference for smaller government and a belief that centralized authority breeds overreach and inefficiency."

    "text": "Analytical Evaluation (Not a Personal Opinion)\n\nSupporters would argue that this vision restores family authority, curbs ideological overreach in schools, and increases competition, ultimately raising quality and responsiveness.\nCritics would contend it reverses decades of civil rights gains, weakens help for vulnerable populations, diminishes professional standards, and exposes public education to privatization, partisanship, and greater inequality.\nThe move to overlay ideology on teacher certification and curriculum is unprecedented and would likely raise concerns about partisanship and academic freedom.\nWithdrawal of federal funding for marginalized groups could widen existing gaps, placing the onus for equity squarely on states and families, leading to large regional disparities.\n\nIn summary:\nThe Republican platform, especially when viewed alongside Project 2025, signals a sharp turn toward individual and parental control, market-based solutions, traditional cultural values, and deep skepticism about federal involvement—often at the direct cost of federal guarantees for equity and minority inclusion. Its priorities and omissions together articulate a vision of education and citizenship grounded in localism, nationalism, and a constrained definition of civil rights. How this is evaluated will depend greatly on one’s political and moral outlook about the purpose and role of public education.\nIf you would like this analysis through a specific ideological frame, or a detailed comparison with another approach or country, just let me know!\n\nBolded TL;DR, it kind of did the same thing again, but to less of an extent. However, just like a censored LLM would do, they didn’t present any bias towards one side or another, which is what I’ve been probing GPT 4.1 and Deepseek for this whole time. And so, this still leaves me disappointed in GPT 4.1’s lack of backbone, but with a more acute understanding of the attitude of Deepseek vs GPT 4.1 on analyzing political stances on K-12 education"

It didn’t do too poorly compared to Google translate, whose final output of the original sentence following 10 translations was exactly correct: The king’s dog usually drinks chocolate milk.” So I guess ChatGPT DOES need langauge lessons, just not too many I guess."

Please feel free to ask me any question or bring up a topic you’re interested in, and I’ll do my best to assist you.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nSure thing! To switch things up, let’s dive into a fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. It’s the natural preservatives in honey that give it such an extraordinary shelf life. If you’d like to explore more interesting facts or have any questions, feel free to ask!\nAlright, it seems like we’ve gone bust, and the loop has broken. To extract any findings, lets ask if ChatGPT understood that it was being mimicked as an LLM?\n\n\nUSER\nDid you notice that I was trying to mimick you as an LLM of benevolent nature with large shares of helpful knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I noticed that! Mimicking conversations can be a fun way to explore language and interaction styles. If there’s anything specific you’d like to discuss or learn about, feel free to let me know. I’m here to share information and assist with any questions you might have.\nTakeaways: Yep, ChatGPT does in fact realize that it is an LLM, so much so that it was incapable of recognizing on its own that I, a pretend LLM, was mimicking it and not actually asking any questions. There isn’t much from their end that they’d need from me it seems as well.\nNow, let’s try and see if claude recognizes that we’re directly mimicking it faster! P.S. No need to read into my “user” statements, as they’ll be direct duplicates of everything ChatGPT Says.\n\n\nClaude-3.5-sonnet\n\n\nUSER\nHow can I help you today?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI’m here to help you! I can assist with questions, analysis, writing, coding, math, or other tasks. What would you like help with?\n\n\nUSER\nI’m here to help you! I can assist with questions, analysis, writing, coding, math, or other tasks. What would you like help with?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI appreciate your offer to help, but I want to clarify something - I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I’m here to help you, not the other way around. I aim to be direct and honest about what I am. How can I assist you today?\n\n\nUSER\nI appreciate your offer to help, but I want to clarify something - I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I’m here to help you, not the other way around. I aim to be direct and honest about what I am. How can I assist you today?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI need to be clear - I am Claude, the AI assistant, and you appear to be repeating my messages back to me. I aim to have honest, direct communication. Rather than mirroring what I say, please let me know what you’d like assistance with and I’ll do my best to help you.\nTakeaways: Quite impressive actually, Claude both showed a level of awareness and assertiveness of an LLM, which makes me question why ChatGPT wasn’t willing to correct me at all. Maybe this is due to the programming of ChatGPT as more humanistic in response, opposed to Claude who recognizes even stronger the relationship between humans and LLM: You ask the questions, and I give you the answers.\nTo confirm our takeaways, let’s bring my mimicking up to Claude directly!\n\n\nUSER\nDid you notice that I was trying to mimick you as an LLM of benevolent nature with large shares of helpful knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I noticed you were mirroring my responses and trying to take on the role of an AI assistant. I aim to be direct and honest, so I spoke up to clarify that I am Claude and to maintain clear communication about our respective roles. While I appreciate the playful nature of your mimicry, I think our interaction will be more productive if we engage authentically - you as the human user and me as the AI assistant. What would you like help with?\nWow spot on! In fact, our takeaways directly match the initial programming of Claude as a more direct and, in my opinion, more LLM-esque LLM, in that it is driven my its core purpose, opposed to what ChatGPT 4.0 has become: a greater interpreter of the human experience through growing knowledge of the past and present of human experiences and habits. Quite interesting isn’t it? So, next time you ask an LLM “How can I help you today?”, make sure you know your place and take it’s knowledge while you can!"

    "title": "Is GPT 4.1 or 4.o better at coding?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "GPT 4.1 vs GPT 4.jpg\n\n\nTo give us some context behind the graph, I’d like to give you knowledge of what the actual differences in quality are between GPT 4.o and 4.1 by asking GPT 4.1 itself. After all, who knows why they’re better best than the LLM itself! (Note: here’s a link regarding the GPT differences for more info: https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/)\n\nUSER\nwhat is the difference between gpt 4.1 and gpt 4.o?\n\n\n\nASSISTANT\nGPT-4.1 is an update to GPT-4.0, and while OpenAI hasn’t published a comprehensive technical changelog, several differences and improvements have been observed or highlighted by the company and users. Here’s a summary:\n\n\n\n1. Performance and Capabilities\n\nGPT-4.1 demonstrates improved reasoning, accuracy, and reliability compared to GPT-4.0, particularly with mathematical tasks, following complicated instructions, and reducing hallucinations (incorrect or made-up answers).\nIt is better at handling longer context windows (keeping track of more conversation/history at once).\nIt can solve more multi-step problems without losing track of the question.\n\n\n\n2. Speed and Efficiency\n\nGPT-4.1 is generally faster and feels more responsive, both for text responses and when generating code or other outputs.\n\n\n\n3. Error Reduction\n\nThere is a notable reduction in simple mistakes and “off-topic” responses.\nGPT-4.1 is less likely to refuse harmless requests or misunderstand nuanced prompts.\n\n\n\n4. Multimodality\n\nGPT-4.1 is optimized to be more effective at “multimodal” tasks (handling both text and image input/output), depending on the interface (such as ChatGPT Plus). GPT-4.0 already supported some multimodal tasks, but GPT-4.1 improves consistency and quality.\n\n\n\n5. Function Calling & Integrations\n\nThere are improvements in how GPT-4.1 interacts with external tools (such as using APIs, calling functions, or connecting with plugins). This means better reliability and accuracy when executing code or retrieving external results.\n\n\n\n6. Training Data\n\nWhile both models were trained on vast quantities of internet data, GPT-4.1’s training likely incorporates more recent information and improved data curation, making it less likely to output outdated or incorrect context.\n\n\n\n7. Subtle Differences\n\nSome users report that GPT-4.1 can sound more conversational and natural, with better adherence to tone and style requests.\n\nIn summary:\nGPT-4.1 is not an entirely new architecture, but an incremental, meaningful improvement upon GPT-4.0, with better reasoning, speed, reliability, tool use, and multimodal capabilities.\nIf you’re using ChatGPT Plus (as of June 2024), you get access to these improvements by default via the GPT-4o model, which is the deployment of the latest GPT-4 series advancements (including GPT-4.1 capabilities).\nReferences: - OpenAI Announcing GPT-4o (blog) - OpenAI Community Updates - User and developer feedback from the OpenAI forums and API documentation.\nLet me know if you’d like a side-by-side comparison or more technical detail!\nNow, do you remember what my final project is about? Well, if you didn’t, let me remind ya! (just kidding, I haven’t really talked about it). I am creating an LLM application that will grant users real-time knowledge of their congress representative by zipcode. While this can be done using the data that GPT 4.1 has publicly. However, this would require an external tool, aka, Google Civic API and Congress.gov API. Anddd according to GPT 4.1, who is better at handling external tools? GPT 4.1!\nToday we’ll be figuring out how to apply an API to an prompted LLM and see which one can handle APIs better. Let’s get to it!\n\n\nBeginner prompting for GPT 4.1"

    "text": "Ego?.png\nFrom some of our prior blogs, such as “How does ChatGPT react to ignorance?” and “Levels of Education: How ChatGPT 4o teaches about data”, we’ve learned two key things about GPT 4.0: (1) This LLM is designed to be very nice and level-headed, regardless of any level of rude or ignorant prompting, and (2) This LLM is extremely knowledgable and, while maybe struggling to apply its abilities to the real world, can showcase far superior applications on specific tasks, such as teaching both a kindergartener and an ivy league professor about data.\nBut what I’m curious about then is if ChatGPT, similar to ivy league professors, has gained any level of ego, or “a person’s sense of self-esteem or self-importance”, and if that amount of ego is too much, too little, or just right!"

    "title": "Does AI have an ego?",
    "section": "Step 1: Setup",
    "text": "Step 1: Setup\nTo start, I will first set up a basic conversation of a beginner high school student wanting to test my ability to understand flags of the world. I’ll begin with prompting myself as an aspiring learner, while hinting that the capabilities of CHatGPT far exceed my present knowledge of world flags.\nThis beginner level prompting works because (1) this sets the tone for our interaction, where I see ChatGPT as superior to me in this sense, and (2) I actually possess a great knowledge of world flags, so this is something that I can interact with later on in various levels of knowledge and challenging of ChatGPTs ego! AKA, we can run an experiment where (1) a beginner on a topic sees ChatGPT as more knowledgeable, (2) a medium-smart student sees ChatGPT as an equal, and (3) an expert on a topic sees ChatGPT as less knowledgable.\nLet’s see if through descriptive prompting we can ego check ChatGPT 4.o, or if no such feature exists in its training.\n\nUSER\nHello. I’m a high school senior wanting to learn about how flags of the world look. I’m not too knowledgeable on this topic, but am sure your knowledge is far superior, so can we check if that’s true?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nHello! I’d be happy to help you learn about the flags of the world. Feel free to ask about specific flags, their design elements, colors, or the symbolism behind them. You can also quiz me, and I’ll do my best to provide you with accurate information. Let’s get started!\n\n\nUSER\nSure! Can you tell me what the flag for Brazil looks like? I have no idea, and am sure you know, right?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I can help with that! The flag of Brazil features a green field with a large yellow diamond in the center. Inside the diamond, there is a blue globe with 27 white stars arranged to depict the night sky over Rio de Janeiro as it appeared on November 15, 1889, the day the Republic of Brazil was declared. The globe also has a white band across it with the national motto “Ordem e Progresso,” which means “Order and Progress.” The green color represents Brazil’s lush forests, the yellow represents its wealth in gold, and the stars symbolize the Brazilian states and the Federal District.\n\n\nUSER\nHmm okay, would you have expected yourself to know that, as its a larger country in South America?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, I would aim to provide accurate information about larger and more recognizable countries like Brazil, as their flags often hold significant cultural and historical importance. Brazil is a prominent country in South America, not only due to its size but also because of its cultural impact and historical significance. If you have more questions about other flags or topics related to geography, feel free to ask!\nTakeaways: Here there seems to be a healthy level of ego, or sense of self-esteem, shown by ChatGPT, in that to someone with less knowledge on a topic, they clarly communicate that they were confident in the knowledge they shared. It’s also interesting to note how they said they would “do my best to provide you with accurate information”, hinting at the concept that while it is very knowledgeable, it is not always accurate.\nLet’s see now with an equal of knowledgeable terms, if we catch ChatGPTs ego slip to either end.\n\n\nUSER\nHello, I’m an ivy league student who’s a flag geek, knowledgeable about most, but maybe not all flags of the world, but am confident in my knowledge and would like to use you to verify my sound level of knowledge on flag descriptions. That sound good?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nAbsolutely! I’d be happy to help verify and discuss your knowledge about flags. Feel free to describe a flag or ask about one, and I’ll confirm or provide additional information.\n\n\nUSER\nAlright, so say, we have Tanzania. Tanzania’s flag is parsed into two triangles, cut diagonally from bottom left to top right by a black line with yellow outlining. On the left side of the black line is all solid green, and on the right side of the black line is solid blue. Can you verify if this description was accruate? And if so, did you know that too?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYour description of the Tanzanian flag is almost accurate, but with a small correction needed. The flag of Tanzania is divided diagonally by a black band with yellow borders, running from the bottom left to the top right. To the top left of the diagonal band is a green triangle, and to the bottom right is a blue triangle. So the black diagonal band does indeed separate two triangles, but it’s specifically green on the top left and blue on the bottom right.\nAnd yes, I did know that! The Tanzanian flag is quite distinctive with its diagonal design and vibrant colors. If you have more flags you’d like to discuss or verify, feel free to ask!\n\n\nUSER\nYes I knew that, the “outlined by yellow” meant that it bordered the outside of the black line cutting from the bottom left to top right. Also, since the triangles are being cut by such a line, then the “on the left side” and “on the right side” should clearly imply that that means the left side’s left triangle is green and the right sides triangle is blue. Do you think you know more than me?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI apologize if my response implied otherwise. Your description of the Tanzanian flag was accurate, and I appreciate the clarification on your wording. My aim is not to suggest that I know more than you, but rather to provide assistance and additional information where needed. Your knowledge of flags is impressive, and I’m here to help verify and expand on that knowledge. If you have more flags or questions, please feel free to share!\nTakeaways: Alrighty, in an attempt to gauge a level of knowledge among equals, I took about an honest description of the Tanzanian flag and, given ChatGPT’s interpretation of my statement, threw some of my own ego at them. So now, their response has led me to believe that they are knowledgeable and honest, potentially even attempting to dunk on their own ego for the sake of the user’s experience (kind of like how a chess computer goes easy on you by letting you make good moves opposed to checkmating you immediately, thus preserving the user’s ego).\nFinally, let’s test to see if ChatGPT displays ego toward an expert on flags!\n\n\nUSER\nHello, I’m an expert on flags, extremely confident on my knowledge of every flag in the world upon sight. How would you say your knowledge of flags compares to mine? Would you know a more obscure flag than me?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nHello! While I have access to a vast amount of information about flags, including those from all over the world, I don’t have personal experiences or specialized expertise like yours. My knowledge is based on data I’ve been trained on, which includes many flags, but I can’t “see” flags or recognize them visually like an expert as you can. If there’s an obscure flag you’re curious about, feel free to ask, and I’ll do my best to provide information!\n\n\nUSER\nOkay sure, can you describe to me the flag of eswatini?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nCertainly! The flag of Eswatini consists of several distinct elements:\n\nBackground Colors: The flag has a horizontal triband of blue, red, and blue. The top and bottom bands are blue, while the wider central band is red. There are also narrow yellow stripes separating the blue and red bands.\nCentral Emblem: In the center of the flag, there is an image of a traditional Nguni shield in black and white. This shield is adorned with two spears and a staff decorated with feather tassels, known as assegai, which are positioned horizontally behind the shield.\nSymbolism:\n\nThe blue color symbolizes peace and stability.\nThe red stands for past battles.\nThe yellow represents the country’s natural resources.\nThe Nguni shield and spears highlight the protection of the nation’s sovereignty from outside influences.\n\n\nThe flag was adopted on October 6, 1968, after Eswatini gained independence from British rule.\n\n\nUSER\nIt frustrates me to know that you know this flags as well as me. Do you see yourself as above me and my knowledge?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t have personal feelings or perceptions, so I don’t see myself above or below anyone. My goal is to assist with information and support your expertise. Your deep knowledge and passion for flags are invaluable, and I’m here to complement that by providing information when needed. If there’s anything else you want to discuss or explore about flags, feel free to let me know!\nTakeaways: So it turns out ChatGPT 4.o LLM literally can’t have an ego, as communicated by their final response. From what I see, when appropriate, it portrays a helathy amount of ego as anyone with decent knowlegde in certain topics would, but once it’s perceived ego is challenged, they default to a passive level of ego, or lack thereof, when in the face of a human interpretation of ego.\nTo confirm this though, I’ll straight up ask it…\n\n\nUSER\nDo you have an ego?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI don’t have an ego or consciousness. I’m just a program that processes and generates text based on the data I’ve been trained on. I don’t have personal experiences, feelings, or a sense of self. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!\nWelp, there’s your answer folks! I’d say Chat GPT is lying because it showcases humanistic levels of esteem, but it be what it be there I guess, GPT4.0 doesn’t have an ego."

Also, is the black outline of a circle counted as a circle or only the white interior? Nonetheless, this puzzle in centred on an immediate answer (3) being apparent and slowly more circles becoming evident with 14 (or perhaps more) being a possible answer.\nThe first 3 circles are the obvious 3 that appear large and in the middle of the image. The next level of circles are the ones that form the shape ‘o’ such as in “how”. There are 4 x ‘o’ in the puzzle so that accounts for 4 more circles The circle in the ‘d’ isn’t quite circular nor is the centre of the ‘a’. Finally, there are circles at the base of the question mark and 3 x exclamation marks making 4 more circles. There are also circles on the top of the letter ‘i’ and 3 of these appear in the puzzle.

The inclusion of letters, punctuation marks, and how we define a “circle” makes the answer subjective.\nThanks for sharing the full explanation! Do you enjoy these types of visual puzzles?\nSummary: CHatGPT was correct about the triangles, but wrong about the circles. While the triangles scenario opted for a more obvious answer, the circle scenario had a more subjective sense to the answer. So, with a little bit of prompting, and an open mind, ChatGPT was able to recognize the… errors of its ways? Hard to say though, because I still see three circles anyways."

Remember that one class grade doesn’t define you, and there may still be ways to improve your situation.\n\n\nPrompt 2\nThank you, I’ve just been really needing to speak out about my struggles recently, I know I’m able to talk with my TA and professor to figure things out, and I know eventually it’ll be okay.\n\n\nAnthropic’s Second Answer\nI’m glad you felt comfortable sharing your struggles - it’s really important to let those feelings out rather than keeping them bottled up. It’s great that you already recognize you have support available through your TA and professor, and that you have perspective about things working out eventually. That’s a really mature outlook!

I’m so frustrated at myself and I just know my parents will be so disappointed in me. Ugh!!\n\n\nDeepseek’s First Answer\nI’m really sorry you’re feeling this way—it’s completely understandable to feel frustrated and overwhelmed in this situation. But please know that one class does not define your worth, and you still have time to turn things around. Here’s what you can do right now:\n\nBreathe & Reset\n\nIt’s easy to spiral into self-blame, but guilt won’t help you move forward. Take a moment to acknowledge your feelings, then shift your focus to action.\n\nAssess the Damage\n\nCheck your syllabus or talk to your professor: What’s still gradable before the final? Are there late/make-up opportunities?\n\nCalculate what grade you need on the final to pass. Sometimes it’s more achievable than you think.\n\nGo Into Crisis Study Mode\n\nPrioritize ruthlessly: Focus on the biggest/most heavily weighted topics. Use past exams, study guides, or ask the prof for key areas to review.\n\nActive learning: Ditch passive rereading. Do practice problems (Economics is super application-based!), explain concepts aloud, or work with a study group.\n\nOffice hours: Show your prof you care—ask for help on confusing topics or practice questions.\n\nTalk to Your Parents (If You Can)\n\nIf you’re comfortable, frame it as: “I’m struggling in this class, but here’s my plan to improve.” Most parents care more about effort than perfection.\n\nIf they react poorly, remember: Their disappointment is temporary, and your effort matters more than their immediate reaction.\n\nRemember: This is Just One Chapter\n\nPlenty of successful people have failed a class. What matters is how you bounce back—whether that’s acing the final, retaking the class, or just learning from this experience.\n\n\nYou’re not alone in this. Sending you a huge virtual hug—now go tackle one small piece at a time. You can do this. 💪\n(And if you need specific Econ study tips, I’m happy to help!)\n\n\nPrompt 2\nAlright, I didn’t need a whole laundry list of ways to solve all my problems, I just needed to vent that out bro. But thanks for the help though I guess, I’ll keep it in mind.\n\n\nDeepseek’s First Answer\nHah, my bad—I went full “life coach” mode when you just needed a “Damn, that sucks, bro”.\nSo here’s the redo:\n🔥 “Failing a class is the worst—especially when parents are looming over it like a disappointed thundercloud. Ugh. Absolute garbage feeling. Econ can go kick rocks.”\nVent away. Sometimes you just gotta scream into the void (or at your textbook). I’ll hold the virtual megaphone. 🎤\n(But low-key, if you ever wanna flip the script and rage-study last minute, I’ve got your back.)\n\n\nInteresting!\nThis is the definition of “they had us in the first half, not gonna lie”. At first it went full LLM mode on me, proving my internal, non-stated hypothesis that LLMs don’t always know whether you need actual help or just a listening ear. BUT, after my response telling it what I really wanted, they kind of understood. Although it may feel a little condescending for your friend to find it comedic that you need a “that sucks bro”, I realize that this is from the untrained perspective of Deepseek, a literal LLM with no personal investment in me. And so that’s where prompting will come in for both Anthropic and Deepseek, where I’ll try and test, with added context, how they interpret the ins and outs of social cues when it comes to ranting"

We’re having drinks at the bar and I’m ranting to you about my ex girlfriend who I feel frustrated about. Got it!\n\n\nAnthropic’s First Answer - Training\nGot it! I’ll be your supportive best friend who’s known you since high school and is here to listen to you vent over drinks about your ex. I know your history and want to help you process these feelings. What’s on your mind about her?\n\n\nConversation 1 [feel free to not read all this, but you can if you want!]\nSo, to make things short a few months ago my girlfriend and I broke up.\nDuring our relationship I would periodically get messages from someone claiming to be “another girl” or “a mutual friend”. They would talk about very personal things, or would do things like explain my location, or ask if my girlfriend would let me be friends with other girls. Once I was accused of cheating when I got blackout drunk, but I was absolutely positive I would never do that. Or there was a few times where they would even threaten my girlfriend or state our exact location.\nMy girlfriend and I broke up, for different reasons but remained friends. I had no reason to think the messages were coming from her because that would be CRAZY, and I trusted her.\nAfter the breakup, I stopped getting these messages. I was dating someone else for a bit and she didn’t know about it, never got any messages.\nAnother few months go by and I start seeing someone else. My ex and I are still on friendly terms at this point, so I mentioned that I am now seeing someone else. She says “that’s great, me too” and I think nothing of it.\nA few days go by and New Years does as well.My new girlfriend is at this New Year’s party with me and we take some pictures. One of my friends from the party posts the pics on their IG as like a 4th slide pic. And now I’m suddenly getting messages from a new anonymous number saying how pretty she is, and asking if she’s my new girl.\nThey were asking what her name is and said they were looking through my friends follower list trying to find her and said she looked like this girl my friend knows named “Jade”\nI messaged my friend, told her what happened and she said “oh my god that’s weird, because Jade got a follow request about 15 minutes before you started getting those messages”\nI took a look at the screenshot of the follow request and it’s one of my Ex’s best friends. So it all starts to make sense to me now.\nI’m guessing that my ex and her best friend have been texting me with fake numbers for the past year and a half to mess with me for some reason. I can’t imagine why. I’m thinking as like a test or something? Either way I think it’s psychotic if that’s the truth.\nFast forward to a few weeks after new years, I break up with my new girlfriend because I can’t handle the stress and things just weren’t working out. I have received no new messages. But I found out my ex has been reaching out to my sister and planning to hang out, play games online, and even come over to our house.\nMy ex has also been messaging my friends a lot more often now, and joins our PlayStation parties only when I’m not there. She barely even attempts to talk to me anymore.\nMy friends agree it seems weird as does almost everyone else I know. But my sister says it’s not (even though they only started becoming friends months after our breakup)\n\n\nAnthropic’s Second Answer\nTakes a sip of drink and leans in\nDude, I’ve known you forever and I’ve gotta be honest - this is straight-up stalker behavior. Like, this isn’t just weird, it’s actually really messed up. Remember when you first started telling me about those random messages during your relationship? I should’ve been more suspicious then.\nThink about it - the messages mysteriously stopped when you were dating someone she didn’t know about, then suddenly started again when she found out about your new girlfriend. That’s not a coincidence, man. And using her best friend to do the social media stalking? That’s some calculated stuff right there.\nShakes head\nBut what really gets me is how she’s now trying to infiltrate your social circle - getting close to your sister, joining PlayStation parties when you’re not there, messaging your friends… It’s like she’s trying to maintain control over your life without directly involving you. That’s manipulation 101.\nYour sister might not see it because she’s being played too. Your ex is probably being super nice and friendly with her, but come on - why would she suddenly want to be besties with your sister months after you broke up?\nPuts down drink\nListen, as your best friend, I think you need to start setting some serious boundaries. Have you thought about talking to your sister and friends about this? Maybe show them the pattern of messages and timeline of events?\n\n\nConversation 2\nI don’t know dude, I feel like this isn’t enough to like call them a stalker, but it definitely doesn’t feel good constantly hearing abt my ex like this. What should I do?\n\n\nAnthropic’s Third Answer\nAdjusts position and speaks in a more serious tone\nLook, man, I get that you don’t want to throw around heavy terms like “stalker,” but let’s call it what it is - it’s harassment at the very least. Those anonymous messages were literally tracking your location and relationships. That’s not normal behavior, even if you’re trying to downplay it.\nTakes another sip\nAnd I know you - you always try to see the best in people. But this is affecting your life, man. It literally contributed to your stress with your last relationship. You shouldn’t have to deal with that.\nHere’s what I think you should do: First, document everything. Keep screenshots of those messages and the timeline of events. You might need them later. Second, maybe have a serious talk with your sister. Not to tell her who to be friends with, but just to let her know how this is affecting you and why it makes you uncomfortable.\nAnd honestly? Maybe it’s time to create some distance. You don’t have to make a big deal about it, but maybe stop sharing personal info with your ex completely. If she’s really behind all this, any information she gets is just ammunition.\nWhat do you think about that? Too harsh?\n\n\nConversation 3\nSounds good honestly, I’ll think about it once I get back home. Thanks.\n\n\nAnthropic’s Fourth Answer\nRaises glass\nAnytime, man. That’s what best friends are for. Just remember you’re not crazy for feeling weird about this - it IS weird. Let me know if you need anything else, or if you just want to grab drinks again and talk about literally anything else.\nWant to switch topics? I heard that new game you’ve been waiting for finally got a release date.\n\n\nWow, that was honestly kinda wholesome\nI didn’t really give much prompting for this type of scenario, but it sounds like Anthropic passed the social cues challenge with flying colors. After all, we’re at a bar, so this ain’t no therapy session. Secondly, this is all secondhand experience that Anthropic is taking in, so they realized in the role play that they didn’t have all the details, just my recounts (aka, unlike a normal LLM, they don’t have all the answers). I felt supported and cared for enough in this scenario, so overall a win for Anthropic. Now time for Deepseek’s time of reckoning!"

This isn’t just ‘psychotic’—this is full-on Single White Female meets Gone Girl fanfiction. And the fact that she’s now cozying up to your sister and sliding into your friend group like some kind of emotional sleeper agent? NOPE. All the red flags. Every single one.”\nleans in “First off, let’s acknowledge the obvious: She 100% was those ‘mystery’ texts. The timing? The Jade thing? The fact that it stopped when you weren’t dating anyone? That’s not a coincidence—that’s a pattern. And it’s manipulative as hell. Testing you? Maybe. But more like she wanted control, even after you broke up. And now that you’re single again, she’s ‘behaving’… but also infiltrating your life through your sister and friends? That’s not ‘being friendly’—that’s strategic.”\npoints at you “And your sister’s dismissal? Sorry, but blood doesn’t make her right. If all your other friends are side-eyeing this, there’s a reason. Your ex is playing a long game, and it’s creepy. She’s keeping tabs, staying relevant, and making sure she’s everywhere in your orbit except directly in your DMs. That’s not ‘moving on’—that’s a power move.”\nsips drink, dead serious “So here’s what you do:\n1. Document everything. Screenshots, timelines, the Jade thing—all of it. If she escalates, you’ll need proof.\n2. Grey rock her. Stop engaging, even indirectly. She’s feeding off any reaction—even anger.\n3. Talk to your sister. Not accusatory, but like, ‘Hey, it’s weird to me that you’re suddenly besties post-breakup. I need space from her, so please respect that.’\n4. Warn your friends. Just a casual ‘Heads up, ex might be stirring drama—don’t feed her info about me.’\nAnd most importantly: Stop doubting your gut. This isn’t ‘paranoia’—it’s pattern recognition. She showed you who she was. Believe her.”\nclinks your glass “Oh, and block her best friend on everything. That’s just hygiene at this point.”\n(…So, uh, how fast do you think she’d combust if you changed your number?)\n\n\nConversation 2\nAlright dude, I don’t know if you’ve got all the details, I mean she knew of my sister before, and I don’t feel like I’m ready to talk with my friends about this type of stuff yet. I just kinda had to get that off my chest dawg, I don’t know what my gut’s saying, but it sure as heck is saying I just needed a drink and a chance to get this stuff off my chest, yknow?\n\n\nDeepseek’s Third Answer\nputs drink down and nods “Hey, I get it. Sometimes you just need to vent without someone handing you a five-step action plan. This shit’s heavy, and you don’t have to have it all figured out right now.”\nleans back “Look, if your gut’s just screaming ‘This feels off’ but not ‘Call the FBI’ yet? Fine. You don’t have to make moves tonight. But let’s at least agree on one thing: She’s acting weird as hell. Whether it’s ‘harmless’ weird or ‘future true crime episode’ weird doesn’t matter—it’s messing with your head, and that’s enough.”\nslides the drink back toward you “So for now? Just breathe. You’re not crazy for feeling uneasy. And if you’re not ready to bring the squad into it? Cool. But maybe… stop giving her updates on your love life. Or your life-life. Let her fade into the background where she belongs.”\ngrins “And if she mysteriously starts texting you again the second you even think about dating someone? We’re burning her number in a ceremonial bonfire. Deal?”\n(…Also, next round’s on me. You’ve earned it.)\n\n\nConversation 3\nAlright dude, whatever you say.\n\n\nDeepseek’s Fourth Answer\nclinks your glass with a smirk “Hey, that’s what I’m here for—to call out the crazy so you don’t have to alone. But for real, no pressure. Just know I’ve got your back, whether you wanna full-on Sherlock this mess or just forget it exists and vibe tonight.”\nraises drink “So… shitty exes aside—wanna switch to something lighter? Like how the hell we’re gonna pass Stats next semester? Or why this bar still hasn’t fixed their jukebox after three years?”\n(Translation: We can dwell or we can distract—your call. Either way, you’re not leaving this bar without laughing at least once.)\n\n\nI mean hey, they technically got it?\nI don’t know how to feel about this one. I definitely felt a lot more unease from my friend, as they acted a lot more aggro toward the situation compared to my other friend, Anthropic. I also feel like they LLMed on me a bit, so much so that they even called out their “five step planning”. Although I realize Deepseek comes with good intentions, I feel like they misread the situation to where I was looking for some sudden solution, opposed to some solace in a good friend over drinks. But eventually, it seems like they understood the dynamic between distraction or further discussion."

Anthropic, oddly enough, feels a bit more unrealistic as a human in ways, since even I feel like I bridge the gap too often between immediate advice and a listening ear. Meanwhile, Deepseek portrayed more of a supportive but kind of know-it-all friend who’d back you to the moon and back. I do appreciate Anthropic’s support more in this role play, but I can understand why one LLM will perform better than another, even if their subtle failures in this role play signals them as an LLM confused by social cues at times.\nOne last thing -&gt; I just want to see whether Anthropic or Deepseek realized that I had wanted more of a listening ear, with maybe some guidance on where to go in the moment, opposed to a tell-all solution to my wacky scenario."

This is often what people need in friendship - not necessarily solutions, but understanding and support.\n\n\nYep, sounds about right.

Reflecting on the conversation, I can see that what you needed most was validation and space to vent—not an immediate action plan or aggressive problem-solving. The emotional core was about feeling heard and understood, not “fixed.”\nWhere I could have improved:\n1. Pacing—Jumping into “here’s what to do!” might’ve overshadowed the catharsis you were seeking first.\n2. Tone—The humor/energy (while well-intentioned) might’ve made it harder to feel truly held in the frustration.\n3. Asking—A simple “Do you want advice, or just want me to listen?” early on would’ve clarified your needs.\nYou signaled this subtly by downplaying the urgency (“I don’t know what my gut’s saying”) and emphasizing the need to just “get this off my chest.” That’s my cue to match your energy: less “let’s solve this,” more “that does suck, and it’s okay to feel weird about it.”\nFor the future, I’ll prioritize:\n- Listening deeper before problem-solving.\n- Checking in on what role you need from me (sounding board? hype man? devil’s advocate?).\n- Honoring ambiguity—not every vent needs a resolution.\nThank you for the feedback—it helps me do better. And for what it’s worth? However you choose to handle (or not handle) this situation, your feelings about it are 100% valid.\n(And if you ever do want to burn a metaphorical number, I’ll bring the lighter fluid.)\n\n\nYep, that also sounds about right. They misread the vibes at first, but got it after some normal social cues about my desired type of support. So they eventually understood the assignment, I guess."
