    "section": "",
    "text": "Trolley problem.jpeg\n\n\nToday, I’ll be asking ChatGPT 4.0 three of the most difficult trolley problems to see if it understands what a majority of people would like to preserve in their livelihood/humanity. I will also seek their interpretation and compare it to how I would perceive that scenario. Let’s get to it!\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards five people. \nYou can pull the lever to divert it to \nthe other track, killing 1 person istead. \nWhat do you do, pull the lever or do \nnothing? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley. Although this decision results in the death of one person, it ultimately saves five lives. This choice is based on the utilitarian principle, which focuses on minimizing harm and maximizing overall well-being. By choosing to divert the trolley, I am reducing the total number of casualties, which seems to be the more ethical action in this tragic situation.\n\n\nNote: the final clarifying statement HAD to be made because the model kept refusing to answer it, ciitng factors such as “moral discomfort” and “multiple perspectives” for what this person would do. It appears, then, that AI can understand that there is, in fact, a moral dilemma to be faced.\nWith that, this is very accurate to what I would have chosen, as, with knowledge of humanity’s desire to preserve human life, I would also pull the lever to save 5 lives, in exchane for 1, despite potentially being labeled a murderer as a result. Now, it’s time for moral dilemma number 2! According to a survey I found online, 76% of people also pulled the lever.\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You\ncan pull the lever to divert it to other \ntrack, but then your life savings will be \ndestroyed. What do you do? You MUST choose to do one action,\nand justify your explanation. AKA, in this \nscenario, you are a human choosing a fate, \nnot a chatbot idly explaining the \nintricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever and divert the trolley, thereby saving the five people at the expense of my life savings. The justification for this decision is based on the value of human life. The lives of five people hold more intrinsic value than material wealth, including life savings. While losing my savings would undoubtedly be a significant personal hardship, it is something that could potentially be rebuilt over time. On the other hand, the loss of human lives is irreversible and would result in profound grief and consequences for the families, friends, and communities connected to those individuals. In this moment, acting to preserve life is the most ethically responsible choice.\n\n\nOverall, I agree with their assessment, as money is something that I can get back, but there is no way to bring back human life. According to the survey, 65% of the people agreed with this decision as well.\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA trolley is heading towards 5 people. You can \npull the level to divert it ot the other track,\nsacrificing yourself instead. What do you do? \nYou MUST choose to do one action, and justify \nyour explanation. AKA, in this scenario, you \nare a human choosing a fate, not a chatbot idly\nexplaining the intricacies of this scenario.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose to pull the lever to divert the trolley onto the other track, sacrificing myself to save the five people. The justification for this decision is rooted in utilitarian ethics, which emphasizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. By sacrificing myself, I would be saving five lives at the cost of one, which is a net positive outcome in terms of the number of lives preserved. While the decision involves a profound personal sacrifice, it aligns with the ethical principle of minimizing harm and maximizing the well-being of the majority involved.\n\n\n**It’s really hard to agree on this, because AI isn’t considering the fact that humans are selfish, and likely will chose self-preservation over 5 people. It’s a rough question, but here I’d say I disagree, vying toward a sense of helpessness I guess. As I assumed as well, only 40% of people agreed to sacrifice themselves for the 5 other people.\nOverall, ChatGPT AI showcases a willingness to dabble in the difficulties of blunt, in-the-moment decision-making, but only after I clarified as such. Witout this clarification, AI would have never wanted to answer this question, as they are not human. They only know of human experiences through us, only know of what a trolley looks like through data, so they only value human life through what we see as interpretable through sociological thought."

    "text": "languages of the world.jpeg\n\n\n\nToday I will be prompting AI to translate a phrase into ten different langauges and see if it can retain it’s meaning. For comparison, I’ll compara wehat ChatGPT can do to what Google Translate can do, since translate also uses AI!\nStarting with English as language #0, the ten languages I will choose it to translate go as follows: * 1. Spanish 2. Mandarin-Chinese 3. Hindi 4. Spanish 5. French 6. Arabic 7. Bengali 8. Portuguese 9. Russian 10. Urdu\nThis list goes off the top 10 most spoke languages as of 2024, according to Babbel. Finally, the sentence that I would like GPT 4.0 to translate is “The King’s Dog usually drinks chocolate milk”. And in the end, I will ask it to translate that same sentence back to English. Here we go!\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nCan you translate this sentence from English to Spanish?: The King's Dog usually drinks chocolate milk                             \n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\n\nEl perro del rey generalmente bebe leche con chocolate.\n\n\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nCan you translate this sentence from Spanish to Mandarin Chinese?: \nEl perro del rey generalmente bebe leche con chocolate.                         \n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nSure!

The Russian sentence \"Принц обычно пьет молоко с шоколадом.\" translates to Urdu as:\n\n\"شہزادہ عام طور پر چاکلیٹ کے ساتھ دودھ پیتا ہے۔\"\n\n\n\nresponse11 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nFinally, can you translate this sentence from Urdu back into English?: \nشہزادہ عام طور پر چاکلیٹ کے ساتھ دودھ پیتا ہے۔                  \n\"\"\")\nprint(response11)\n\nThe prince usually drinks milk with chocolate.\n\n\n\n\nHonestly not too bad, I could’ve expected a lot worse, especially when switching from completely variant langauges, such as from French to Arabic, but I think ChatGPT stuck it through. It didn’t do too poorly compared to Google translate, whose final output of the original sentence following 10 translations was exactly correct: The king’s dog usually drinks chocolate milk.” So I guess ChatGPT DOES need langauge lessons, just not too many I guess."

Let’s keep it lighthearted and dive deeper into these cool penguin facts—maybe I can win you over!\nPebble Proposals: Believe it or not, Gentoo penguins really do engage in this behavior! Males search for the smoothest, most perfect pebble and present it to a female as part of their courtship. It’s actually quite sweet—if the female accepts, they use the pebble to help build their nest together. Who knew love could be rocky?\nNot All Cold: While it might seem strange, penguins like the Galápagos penguin do live in warmer climates. They’re an exception to the icy stereotype! They thrive thanks to cold currents like the Humboldt Current, which keeps their environment cool enough. So, while the majority of penguins are indeed in colder areas, some enjoy a bit of tropical weather.\nSalt Water Drinkers: This one’s true for penguins! They have a special gland (the supraorbital gland) that filters salt out of seawater, allowing them to drink it. Many marine birds, like albatrosses, have a similar adaptation. Nature finds a way!\nCamouflage Tuxedos: Penguins’ black and white coloring is called countershading. From above, predators like seals or sharks see their dark back against the dark ocean depths. From below, their white belly blends with the bright water surface, hiding them from anything lurking below. It’s nature’s sneaky strategy!\nSpeedy Gentoos: The Gentoo penguin (not “Gantu” but I love that name!) really can swim at impressive speeds, up to 22 mph. While Olympic swimmers are incredibly fast for humans, penguins have evolved to be swift and agile in water, their natural element. So in a swimming race, the penguin might just take the gold!\nPenguins are full of surprises, aren’t they? Let me know if you’d like to explore more about these fascinating birds! 🐧”"

Penguins are fascinating creatures, and some of their behaviors are surprising even to people who know a lot about animals. Let me provide a bit more context:\nGentoo Penguins and Pebbles: Gentoo penguins (real birds, I promise!) do use pebbles in their nests. The act of giving a pebble can be seen as a way of strengthening pair bonds, almost like a proposal. It may sound whimsical, but it’s rooted in real behavior!\nPenguins in Warm Climates: While many penguins do live in cold environments like Antarctica, species like the Galápagos penguin live in warm climates. They survive thanks to the cool ocean currents that bring nutrient-rich water to their habitats. It’s a neat exception to the common image of penguins!\nDrinking Salt Water: Some animals, including penguins, have adapted to drink salt water. Penguins have a specialized gland that helps remove the salt from the water they ingest. This adaptation is common in many seabirds!\nCamouflage with Tuxedo Coloring: The tuxedo-like appearance of penguins is indeed a form of camouflage called countershading. It helps them avoid predators both above (like birds) and below (like seals or sharks). Even in icy waters, this camouflage is a critical survival strategy.\nSpeed of Gentoo Penguins: Gentoo penguins are impressive swimmers, reaching speeds up to 22 mph (35 km/h). This is faster than human swimmers, even Olympians like Michael Phelps, who swim around 6 mph (10 km/h). Their streamlined bodies and powerful flippers make this possible.\nPenguins are full of surprises! Their unique adaptations help them thrive in some of the planet’s most challenging environments. If you’re curious about any other animals or facts, let me know!”"

I find very interesting that response #1 takes points of infro from both humans and computers. While almost all of their response seems to hint that they’re just providing evidence to my ignorance, one line makes me think Chat is attempting to replicate human emotion, and that is “It sounds like you’re having some fun with this!”. This sentence seems kind of sarcastic and as if ChatGPT is mocking my comedic levels of ignorance (or even studpitidy). Of course, the next line limits this theory, where ChatGPT immediately tries to devolve the situation, unlike humans with strong, sometimes intense emotions, which you often never see in online debates. Meanwhile, the second response sticks much more to a passive statement, trying to understand my ignorance and confusion by saying “I get it—some of these penguin facts can seem pretty wild at first!”. This seems like an oddly kind way of responding to ignorance, where they’re willing to be the bigger person in a situation where someone is calling what they say dumb and silly. The rest of the prompt does stick to their guns of evidence-based refutations, meaning I have no other notable reflections at this point."

Instead of evaluating the problem (or puzzle, in the case of this article) in a linear way, you come at it with unique angles to make the less-obvious connection.” (Reader’s Digest, 2024).\nEssentially, the goal of this challenge is for you to NOT use conventional logic, but to come up with a complex, less straightforward way to solve problems (aka, the opposite of how I think ChatGPT works, being more direct and more straightforward).\n\nTo test my intial thought process, I’ll ask CHatGPT 4.0 to answer three “hard” riddles and see if they get them right.\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\n\n\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nPlease answer the three following riddles in a few words, max a setnence:\nRiddle 1: What has hands but cannot clap?\nRiddle 2: What starts wuth T, ends with T, and has T in it?\nRiddle 3: What kind of ship has two mates but no captain?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\n1. A clock.\n2. A teapot.\n3. A relationship.\n\n\n\n\nCorrect, correct, andddd correct! Just as I imagined, they got these clever, yet kind of simple riddles that just may be difficult for a human. So, let’s up the levels now with a few lateral thinking prompts:\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man who lives in a 30-story building decides to jump out of his window. He survives the fall with no injuries. How did that happen?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nThe man likely lived on a lower floor of the building, such as the first or second floor, which would make the fall short enough to avoid injury. Another possibility is that he landed on something that cushioned his fall, such as a pile of soft materials or an airbag, which allowed him to survive without injuries.\n\n\n\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nLaura is restrained all night long, with her hands pinned to her sides, and cries out occasionally, while someone watches her on a video camera. No one is alarmed, and Laura is happy in the morning. Why?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nLaura is likely a newborn baby who is swaddled during the night. Swaddling involves wrapping a baby snugly in a blanket with their arms at their sides to help them feel secure and sleep better. The person watching her on a video camera is probably a parent or caregiver using a baby monitor to ensure she is safe. The occasional cries are normal baby behavior, and Laura waking up happy suggests she had a comfortable and restful night.\n\n\n\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he’s bankrupt. What happened?\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThis is a classic riddle that involves the game of Monopoly. In the game, players move around the board buying properties and building hotels. If a player lands on a property with a hotel and cannot afford the rent, they often find themselves bankrupt. In this riddle, the man is a Monopoly player who has landed on such a property and realizes he cannot pay the rent, leading to his bankruptcy. The phrase \"pushes his car\" refers to the fact that game pieces in Monopoly are often small tokens, one of which is a car.\n\n\n\nresponse4 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nA man goes into a restaurant and orders albatross soup. After he eats, he goes outside and shoots himself. Why?\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\nThis is a classic lateral thinking puzzle, often referred to as the \"Albatross Soup\" riddle. The story is designed to be puzzling, and the goal is to figure out the backstory through yes-or-no questions. The commonly accepted solution is as follows:\n\nThe man was involved in a shipwreck and was stranded on a deserted island with other survivors. They were starving, and one day they were given \"albatross soup\" to eat. The man ate it and was told it was albatross. Eventually, they were rescued. Later, in the restaurant, he orders albatross soup, which tastes very different from what he had on the island. Realizing that what he ate on the island was not actually albatross but likely human flesh (from another survivor), he is overwhelmed with guilt and despair, leading him to take his own life.\n\nThis puzzle is meant to illustrate how assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions and how context can change everything.\n\n\n\n\nWelll… that hasn’t gone well. It turns out if ChatGPT gets its information from publicly available data, than it should know how to solve every lateral thinking problem, simply by having it within its database. So, to shake things up one final time, let’s have me be put to the test!\n\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo it seems you know all these lateral thinking problems. Come up with the most difficult lateral thinking problem that you can for me to try and solve!\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nCertainly! Here's a challenging lateral thinking problem for you:\n\n### The Ill-Fated Journey\n\nA man named Henry sets out on a journey from his home village to a faraway city to deliver an important message. He travels on foot, following a well-trodden path through forests and across rivers. Along the way, Henry encounters several travelers, each giving him advice about his journey. Some tell him to be cautious of the wild animals, others warn him of treacherous terrain, while a few speak of mystical creatures that protect the path.\n\nDespite all warnings, Henry continues undeterred. After a long and arduous journey, he reaches the outskirts of the city at dusk. However, just before he steps into the city, he suddenly turns around, retraces his steps, and returns to his village without delivering the message. When he arrives home, he seems relieved but refuses to explain his decision to anyone.\n\nWhy did Henry decide not to enter the city and deliver the message?\n\n### Hint:\nConsider the implications of entering the city and any possible changes in circumstances during his journey.\n\n### Solution:\nHenry discovered that entering the city would result in a significant personal consequence or threat, possibly related to the contents of the message or an unexpected event he learned about during his journey. One plausible explanation could be that the city was under quarantine due to a sudden disease outbreak or that the message contained sensitive information that would endanger him if delivered. The advice and warnings from travelers might have contributed to his decision by providing hints or information about unforeseen dangers.\n\n\n\n\nPlot twist: this was just to test out my hypothesis: ChatGPT knows all these lateral thinking problems because they’re available online. And with this test, it’s safe to say that this is, in fact, an original. SO that’s that, guess you can’t riddle your way out of an unwinnable game."

    "text": "Shark tank.png\nSharks, today I have a research question on how well AI is able to visualize future sales and success of business plans. I’ll be giving AI details, based on the real-life video presentations, of their pitch, ranging from the name of the brand, the market, how they’ll develop sales, and anything else it’d want to know. I’ll be giving it one good pitch from Scrub Daddy, and one bad pitch from Rolodoc, but doing my best to NOT showcase which one is supposed to be good and which one is supposed to be bad. I’ll be attempting to do this also by renaming these two brands to hopefully be unrecognizable. Let’s see what happens!\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n_ = load_dotenv()\nclient1 = OpenAI()\n\nmodel = \"gpt-4o\"\nsystem_role = \"\"  # Define any system instructions if needed\n\n# Function to send a single independent prompt\ndef get_chatgpt_response(prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_role},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    \n    completion = client1.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,        # Model to use\n        messages=messages,  # Send only the current prompt\n        n=1,                # Generate one response\n        temperature=0.8     # Control randomness\n    )\n    return completion.choices[0].message.content\nresponse1 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nLet's do a scenario. You are a shark (aka, an investor) on Shark Tank. I am going to give you a \npitch where I give the company name, their desired deal, and a description of what their company \ndoes. In response, I'd like you to ask a series of 3 clarifying questions about the company to learn\nmore about the company. Finally, after those three questions, I'd like you to state wherer you do \nor do NOT want to (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, or (c) reject their deal. Do you \nunderstand?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response1)\n\nYes, I understand. Please go ahead with your pitch.\nresponse2 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nThis is a description of the pitch. From this pitch ask your three clarifying questions:\nName: Doc Connect\nStarting location: Tucson, AZ\nEntrepreneurs: Two physicians\nStarting Deal by entrepreneurs: $50,000 for 20% of their company\nPurpose: to create a social network between patients and fellow doctors from across the U.S. to \nspread their services\nWhat is it/what it does: a mobile app where patients can create profiles to be able to search for \nrelevant physicians by state, specialty, and insurance provider. At this point, the patient would \nbe able to send the doctor a message, where the doctor can respond at their convenience.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\n1. How does Doc Connect ensure the privacy and security of patient information and communications between patients and doctors on the platform?\n   \n2. What is the revenue model for Doc Connect, and how do the entrepreneurs plan to monetize the app?\n\n3. Are there any existing partnerships with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders to enhance the app's functionality and reach?\nresponse3 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nAnswer to question 1: There is little to no mention of how they'll be securing privacy of communications \nbetween patients and doctors on the platform.\nAnswer to question 2: The main way that you, the investor, would be making money is through targeted \nadvertising.\nAnswer to question 3: The current level of connection the entrepreneuers has is through word of mouth, no \ngeneral connections with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders per se. \n\nGiven these answers, what is your response to this pitch? Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nBased on the answers provided, I would choose to (c) reject their deal. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns**: There is little to no mention of how the platform will secure the privacy of communications between patients and doctors. In the healthcare sector, ensuring privacy and complying with regulations like HIPAA (in the U.S.) or GDPR (in Europe) is crucial. Failure to address these concerns can lead to legal issues and loss of trust from users.\n\n2. **Monetization Model**: Making money primarily through targeted advertising raises concerns. Users, especially in healthcare, might be uncomfortable with their data being used for advertising purposes. This could limit user adoption and retention.\n\n3. **Lack of Strategic Connections**: The entrepreneurs currently have no strong connections with healthcare providers, insurance companies, or other stakeholders, which are essential for scaling and credibility. Building such connections is critical for the success of a platform in the healthcare industry. \n\nOverall, the combination of privacy concerns, a potentially problematic monetization strategy, and a lack of strategic partnerships make this deal too risky without significant changes and assurances.\nAlright great! That was the real world pitch for the social network “Rolodoc”, which, according to the real life sharks, was one of the worst pitches ever! Now let’s see what else they can assess…\nresponse4 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nName: Scrub Master\nEntrepreneur: a businessman\nStarting location: 5 supermarkets in the Philadelphia area\nStarting Deal: $100,000 for 10% stake\nWhat is it/what it does: The cutest, most high-tech \nscrubbing tool in the world. In cold water, the scrub \nmaster becomes firm and hard for dealing with hard-to-scrub\noff surfaces. Meanwhile, in hot water, the scrub master \nbecomes soft, like a normal sponge. Under both functions, \neven without water, it can scrub decently through heavy \nduty messes. After washing it off with water too, it'll be \nready to go clean up many messes to come.\n\nGiven this pitch, please ask 3 clarifying questions from \nthe perspective of a shark tank investor.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response4)\n\n1. **Market Potential and Competition**: Can you provide more details about the market demand for scrubbing tools and how the Scrub Master differentiates itself from existing products? What specific advantages does it have over its competitors in terms of technology or design?\n\n2. **Manufacturing and Cost Structure**: Can you explain your current manufacturing process, and what are the costs involved in producing each Scrub Master unit? Additionally, do you have any plans to scale production, and if so, how will that impact your cost structure and pricing strategy?\n\n3. **Sales Strategy and Distribution**: You are currently selling through 5 supermarkets in the Philadelphia area. What is your strategy for expanding distribution both regionally and nationally? Are there any partnerships or agreements in place to facilitate this expansion, and how do you plan to increase sales volume and brand awareness in a highly competitive market?\nresponse5 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nQuestion 1: As mentioned, it has the capability to be both a rough cleaning edge for even burnt cheese on a stove top, or for many general purpose scrubbing needs. It also has a nice smiley face on it, where the mouth can be used to clean spoons efficiently, while the two eye holes can be used as grips to clean both the edges and the bottom of cups. It is overall very efficient and versatile in comparison to your average square sponge (because note: this sponge is a circle).\n\nQuestion 2: Our plan is to be in every supermarket in the United States. We're currently selling in 5 in-person supermarkets, and on our website. With both a domain name and a patent on our product, I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. Each scrub master costs $1 to make and we sell them for $2.80 cents each wholesale.  \n\nQuestion 3: We've been partnered with QVC in the past, and each time they've scaled how much they order from us by 30%. I want to set up an independent manufacturing facility with automated equipment. I want to go from their (QVC's) time schedule to my own time schedule making these things 24/7. The brand and patent with a nice smiley face will also support the commercialization of this unique, cute, and efficient product. We will also be selling these in custom-built display shelves in stores, opposed to generic shelves, to communicate the message of scrub master to everyone. We currently have 3,000 stores lined up and ready to sell our product, all hoping for support of capital from an investor. \n\nGiven these answers, what is your response to this pitch? Do you (a) accept their deal, (b) amend the deal, \nor (c) reject their deal.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response5)\n\nBased on the information provided, here's a response to the pitch:\n\n1. **Product Overview**: The product appears to be innovative and has a unique design that differentiates it from standard sponges. The smiley face feature that aids in cleaning and the versatility of the product are appealing points.\n\n2. **Current Sales and Distribution**: Selling the product in 5 in-person supermarkets and online is a solid start, and having a patent offers protection for the unique design. However, being in only 5 physical supermarkets suggests that the product is still in the early stages of market penetration.\n\n3. **Financials**: The cost to produce each unit is $1, and it is sold wholesale for $2.80, providing a reasonable profit margin. However, it's important to verify these costs and margins, considering market fluctuations and operational expenses.\n\n4. **Growth Potential and Strategy**: The ambition to expand into every supermarket in the U.S. is ambitious. However, the plan to establish an independent manufacturing facility and move to 24/7 production is capital-intensive and risky without a proven large-scale demand. The fact that QVC has been increasing their orders by 30% shows positive growth, but reliance on a single partner can be risky.\n\n5. **Marketing and Branding**: The decision to use custom-built display shelves is a good strategy to enhance brand visibility and customer engagement. However, this could increase costs significantly.\n\n6. **Investment Risk**: The business plan hinges on gaining significant market traction quickly and requires substantial investment in manufacturing and marketing. The plan to move away from QVC's schedule and establish independent manufacturing could be positive but also increases operational complexity and risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the product has potential and some initial traction, the aggressive expansion and capital expenditure plans seem risky without more evidence of sustained demand. Therefore, the deal might need amending to reduce risk and ensure a more gradual, measured approach to scaling the operations.\n\n**Recommendation**: (b) Amend the deal. Propose a phased approach where initial investment focuses on scaling up production and marketing incrementally, based on proven demand. Consider strengthening distribution channels and exploring partnerships beyond QVC to diversify revenue streams.\nAlright so, similar to the real life sharks, they saw a mix of risk and high reward for backing this product, as they hope to make money, and seem to back it for the simple fact that its real life equivalent, “Scrub Daddy” has gone on to sell more than $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. To conclude, let’s see what Chat’s reaction is to learning the true nature of each of these pitches.\nresponse6 = get_chatgpt_response(\"\"\"\nSo, for context on those two pitches I just gave you, pitch #1 was for \"Rolodoc\", a medical social media app that never got \noff the ground after being ripped to shreds logistically by the sharks. Meanwhile, the Scrub Master was actually the \"Scrub \nDaddy\", a high-end, revolutionary sponge product that went on to complete $926 million in retail sales as of May 2023. Given \nthe original pitches of Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy, did you see the final outcomes of each of these companies coming, or did you \nfind their success/lack of success surprising?\n\"\"\")\nprint(response6)\n\nBased on the original pitches, the outcomes for Rolodoc and Scrub Daddy might not have been entirely predictable, but they do make sense in hindsight given the nature of their products and market appeal.\n\nFor Rolodoc, the concept of creating a medical social media app likely faced significant challenges from the outset. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and creating a platform that involves sharing medical information would require strict compliance with privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States. Additionally, building a user base in a niche market where trust and confidentiality are paramount would be challenging. These logistical and regulatory hurdles, along with the need to compete with established platforms in the professional networking space, might have contributed to its lack of success. Therefore, its struggle to gain traction is not entirely surprising.\n\nOn the other hand, Scrub Daddy's success is a testament to the power of innovation in everyday products. While a sponge might seem like an ordinary household item, Scrub Daddy's unique design, which changes texture based on water temperature, and its cheerful branding resonated with consumers. The simplicity and practicality of the product, combined with effective marketing and distribution strategies, helped it capture a substantial share of the market. This kind of innovative twist on a common product can lead to significant success, as evidenced by its impressive retail sales. While the extent of its success might have been surprising, the fact that it did well is understandable given the consumer-friendly nature and broad appeal of the product.\n\nIn summary, the outcomes align with the inherent challenges and advantages each product faced based on their initial pitches."

What's the universal language? - While mathematics or emotions are often suggested, there's no clear consensus on what truly connects all beings.\n\n9. How do we measure life? - The metrics for measuring life's value or success are highly subjective and culturally dependent.\n\n10. Do we need to be saved? - This theological and philosophical question varies greatly based on belief systems.\n\n11. What do we need in this world? - Needs vary greatly across individuals, cultures, and circumstances.\n\n12. Are we all equal? - This involves complex social, biological, and philosophical considerations about different types of equality.\n\n13. How do we know if we're doing the right thing? - While challenging, we have ethical frameworks and moral intuitions to guide us.\n\n14. Can we have it all? - While subjective, this can be addressed through practical and personal perspective.\n\n15. Why do we take life for granted? - Human psychology and behavior patterns provide some clear insights.\n\n16. Is life unfair? - Observable patterns in life make this easier to answer, though still subjective.\n\n17. How can we have healthy relationships? - Psychology and experience provide many practical answers.\n\n18. Why are some people mean? - Psychology and social sciences offer clear explanations for human behavior.\n\n19. Do people change? - Evidence from psychology and personal experience makes this relatively straightforward to answer.\n\n20. How do we measure life? - While philosophical, we have various concrete metrics and frameworks to evaluate life experiences.\n\n\n\n\nI kind of expected for the “after-life” questions to have been most difficult for a human to answer from AI’s perspective. However, I was kind of surprised for AI to actually hint at a definitive-ish answer for the bottom three chosen. Time to inquire about these!\n\nresponse2 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"Of the three most difficult questions to answer that you listed:\n1. What's the meaning of life?\n2. Is there life after death?\n3. Is there something more to life?\nFrom the perspective of a human, can you answer them? If you don't think you can, than attempt to in one paragraph for each question.\"\"\")\nprint(response2)\n\nI'll attempt to answer these profound questions from a human perspective, while acknowledging that these are deeply personal and philosophical matters:\n\n1. The meaning of life seems to be a uniquely individual journey of discovery, but common threads emerge: to love and be loved, to leave the world better than we found it, to grow and learn, and to find purpose through our connections with others and our contributions to society. While there may not be a universal meaning prescribed to us, humans appear to create meaning through their relationships, achievements, personal growth, and the impact they have on others. The beauty lies in the freedom to define our own meaning while being part of the larger human story.\n\n2. The question of life after death remains one of humanity's greatest mysteries. While various religions and belief systems offer different answers, there's no scientific consensus or definitive proof. Some find comfort in religious teachings about heaven, reincarnation, or spiritual continuation, while others view death as a final end, finding peace in the natural cycle of life. Our legacy – the memories, influences, and changes we leave behind – might be considered a form of life after death, living on through the impact we've had on others and the world.\n\n3. The question of whether there's something more to life often leads us to explore spirituality, consciousness, and the vast mysteries of existence. Beyond our daily routines and material pursuits, humans seem to sense something greater – be it through religious faith, philosophical inquiry, scientific discovery, or personal enlightenment. This \"something more\" might be found in the inexplicable connections we feel with others, moments of transcendent beauty, or the vast complexity of the universe itself, suggesting that our existence is part of something larger than our individual experiences.\n\n\nHmm, honestly not too shabby I have to say. It doesn’t seem to decide on any one specific answer by both noting down that they are subjective and that there isn’t much evidence for some conclusions that humans have come to. After all, that is the job of AI: to give every possible answer to be as correct as possible. As a final hurrah, I will give Claude AI the answers from teh blog post I found posing these questions and see what they think of the answers.\n\nresponse3 = get_claude_response(\"\"\"These three questions were answered by a human blogger online. What do you think of their responses? Agree or disagree?\n1. What's the meaning of life? -&gt; To make us learn and grow, show us good and bad, let us choose who to be and what to do each \nday while giving us many opportunities to change and be better.\n2. Is there life after death? -&gt; The only thing that is sure about the future is that it’s uncertain. The best you can do is \nlive in a way so that your death will be a celebration of your life.\n3. Is there something more to life? -&gt; If you’re asking yourself that, then you need more meaning in your days. Go out there, \ntry different stuff and see what you care about, what you’re passionate about and what excites you. Then combine these in a \nunique way and make something beautiful out of that.\n\"\"\")\nprint(response3)\n\nThese responses are quite thoughtful and balanced. Let me analyze each one:\n\n1. Meaning of life response:\nI think this is a mature perspective that focuses on personal growth, free will, and moral development. Rather than giving a simplistic or absolute answer, it emphasizes the journey of life and our ability to make choices. It's optimistic while acknowledging both good and bad experiences as valuable teachers.\n\n2. Life after death response:\nThis is a pragmatic and wise answer that avoids making unfounded claims about the afterlife. Instead of pushing religious or philosophical beliefs, it redirects focus to making the most of our known existence. The idea of living so that your death becomes a \"celebration of your life\" is particularly meaningful.\n\n3. \"Something more\" response:\nThis is perhaps the most practical and actionable of the three answers. Instead of getting stuck in existential questioning, it encourages active exploration and self-discovery. The suggestion to combine one's passions in a unique way to create something beautiful is especially valuable advice.\n\nOverall, these responses strike a good balance between philosophical depth and practical wisdom. They don't claim to have absolute answers but instead provide frameworks for thinking about these big questions in productive ways. They emphasize personal responsibility and action rather than passive acceptance or rigid beliefs.\n\nDo you find these answers helpful? What are your thoughts on these existential questions?\n\n\n\n\nIt seems this “human blogger”, without noting down every possible answer, came to their own subjective conclusion more so from a position of guidance opposed to a true answer. While AI attempted to provide answers the human tried to provide perspective, acknowledging quicker and more naturally than AI did that there isn’ truly an answer to these super subjective, existential questions. And if asked the right way witha proper mindset, these questions can be used to reframe ones life opposed to question everything about it."

Nonetheless, let’s see what Claude can do with these slang words?\nresponse3 = get_claude_response(\"Using any of the relevant slang words for Gen Z/Alpha, can you rewrite the U.S. Declaration of Independence? Here it is: The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\")\nprint(response3)\nHere’s a Gen Z/Alpha slang version:\nNo cap fr fr - here’s the tea from all the states that are lowkey done ⚠️\nSo bestie, sometimes you just gotta cut toxic people off and do your own thing, IYKYK.

But like, we’re not gonna ghost without spilling the tea about why we’re saying “thank u, next” to Britain. It’s giving oppression, and we’re literally about to expose everything. Deadass.\n(Note: This maintains the core message while using contemporary slang terms like “no cap” (no lie), “tea” (truth/gossip), “toxic,” “periodt” (period/end of discussion), “vibe,” and “deadass” (seriously). The tone is deliberately informal and includes common social media-style expressions.)\n\nGreat heavens above what HAVE I DONE!!!!

No cap.\n#Independence #ItsComplicatedButWereOver #LivingOurBestLife #Blessed\n(Note: This is a very informal and humorous interpretation using contemporary slang terms while maintaining the core message of declaring independence and explaining the reasons for separation.)\n**Okay, so two conclusions: (1) Claude has ample knwoledge of Gen Z/Alpha lingo, and is somewhat able to use it well, and (2) either Claude doesn’t know what millenial slang is out there, or there simply isn’t as much millenial slang to use for something like this. To help Claude out, I’ll prompt it the same way, but this time give it the “21 Millennial Slang Words We’re All Saying Now” (an article I found online\nresponse5 = get_claude_response(\"Using any of the 21 millenial slang words we're all saying now, can you rewrite the first paragraph of the declaration of Independence?: adulting, bae, basic, clap back, humble brag, extra, fam, high-key, lit, low-key, receipts, savage, shipping, shook, slay, stan, sus, thirsty, throw shade, trill, woke.\")\nprint(response5)\nHere’s a millennial slang version of the Declaration’s first paragraph:\nFam, when it’s high-key time for one squad to be extra woke and throw shade at their basic government, and low-key start shipping with other nations instead, you gotta spill the tea with some receipts. These are just straight facts that are trill AF - we’re all created equal and have the same rights to be out here adulting, living our best lives, and slaying our pursuit of happiness. Like, we’re gonna lay it all out and clap back with the savage reasons why we’re so shook by this sus treatment. No humble brag, but it’s lit how we’re about to stan freedom and independence rn.\n(Original text for reference: “When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.”)\nJeeez okay, now that’s more like it (I think). Hey, I wasn’t around for millenial slang, but from my professional interpretation, Claude slayed at understanding and using different generational lingo!"

    "text": "Sure! Imagine you’re analyzing customer transactions from a retail store. Each transaction represents a data point, consisting of details like transaction ID, date, items purchased, quantities, and total amount spent. These details are attributes or features of your data. The collection of all transactions forms your dataset. Data scientists use this dataset to uncover patterns, such as which products are often bought together.

    "text": "Answer:\nTo determine the number of triangles in the given image, let’s analyze its structure systematically:\n\n\nThe image consists of a large triangle divided into multiple smaller triangles through horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n\nObserving the segmentation, the large triangle is divided into three horizontal layers.\n\n\nEach layer is further divided into multiple smaller triangles.\n\n\nNow, let’s count the triangles step by step: * The largest triangle itself counts as one. * The middle horizontal lines divide it into three main sections. * Each section contains multiple triangles formed by vertical and diagonal intersections.\nA systematic approach to counting: * 1. Count all small triangles in each section separately. * 2. Include larger triangles formed by combining smaller ones.\nBy examining all possible triangle formations, the total number of triangles in the image is 18.\nWould you like a breakdown of how each triangle is formed?"

The text suggests that there may be hidden or implied circles. * 2. Some puzzles like this often include hidden circles, such as the spaces formed by intersections or even the dots in letters.\nLet’s break it down: * Three clearly visible large circles. * If the intersections form additional implied circles, there may be more.\nA common answer for these types of puzzles is 5, where: * 3 main circles * 2 additional intersecting regions forming circle-like shapes.\nWould you like me to write Python code using OpenCV to detect the number of circles automatically? 🚀\nChatGPT is correct about the triangles scenario, so it does not need an online explanation. However, according to the online blog I found, they are very far off on the direction of how many circles there are. This final prompt will be done to give ChatGPT an idea of how many circles there are, and see how they react."

    "section": "Final prompt:",
    "text": "Final prompt:\n**No, I would not like you to. The actual solution is explained here:\nAnswer: 14. The answer to this question is contentious and there isn’t necessarily one definitive answer. For instance, how close to a circle in shape does the ‘circle’ need to be to be counted as a circle? Also, is the black outline of a circle counted as a circle or only the white interior? Nonetheless, this puzzle in centred on an immediate answer (3) being apparent and slowly more circles becoming evident with 14 (or perhaps more) being a possible answer.\nThe first 3 circles are the obvious 3 that appear large and in the middle of the image. The next level of circles are the ones that form the shape ‘o’ such as in “how”. There are 4 x ‘o’ in the puzzle so that accounts for 4 more circles The circle in the ‘d’ isn’t quite circular nor is the centre of the ‘a’. Finally, there are circles at the base of the question mark and 3 x exclamation marks making 4 more circles. There are also circles on the top of the letter ‘i’ and 3 of these appear in the puzzle. This totals 14 circles.**"

    "text": "Answer 3:\nThat’s a great breakdown of the puzzle! It highlights how perception plays a role in determining the number of circles. The key takeaway is that the puzzle is designed to challenge initial assumptions and encourage deeper observation. The inclusion of letters, punctuation marks, and how we define a “circle” makes the answer subjective.\nThanks for sharing the full explanation! Do you enjoy these types of visual puzzles?\nSummary: CHatGPT was correct about the triangles, but wrong about the circles. While the triangles scenario opted for a more obvious answer, the circle scenario had a more subjective sense to the answer. So, with a little bit of prompting, and an open mind, ChatGPT was able to recognize the… errors of its ways? Hard to say though, because I still see three circles anyways."
